{"text": ["This is the most impactful sci-fi series I've ever read.  What I mean by that, is that this series has permanently changed: the way I look at the stars, the way I perceive time, the way I think about life, the way I think about SETI, the way I think about the meaning of life, the way I think about human beings' place in the universe, the way I view technology, etc.<br /><br />This series well and truly &#34;blew my mind away&#34;.  This isn't a page0-turning space opera adventure kind of story.  The story is interesting and good, and there is most definitely some drama and entertainment - and the writing is excellent (translation to English is superb).  But the main thing for me about this series is that it educated me about physics and really made me look at EVERYTHING through a new lens.  The ideas in this book I had never encountered before - and I am a voracious reader.  I found this series to be totally original and mind-blowing.  There were time where I simply needed to put it down after reading only a short time, in order to simply ponder the ideas presented.  I've never had quite an experience like this with a book.<br /><br />Highly recommend this series.  And, make sure you read all three, because each one is better than the last.  The last book of the series was my favorite and just absolutely melted my brain.  I mean, to the degree where I am questioning my own reality.  Yes, it is that good.  Really, a mind and perception altering experience."]}

Utter-Rancid-Rotting-Garbage!!!<br /><br />To leave my sardonic humour aside for a second, perhaps it really did not translate well from Chinese...similar to how Crazy Rich Asians (also garbage, but entertaining garbage!) was hugely profitable in the US, but an absolute bomb at China’s Box Office.<br /><br />I’m so alone...someone please help me...please explain how I was led astray by so many?!"]}
{"text": ["I'm about 25% into the book. I doubt I'll finish it. I have a Ph.D. in Physics, and my graduate program had a strong Particle Physics department (though I specialized elsewhere). The author shows a startling lack of understanding of what motivates Physicists and how they think, to a point where the book is ruined for me.<br /><br />There is also rather ... amateur hour writing, which may be due to the translator.<br /><br />Spoiler version:<br /><br />In the book plot, the invariance of physics under translations in time and space has been proved to be wrong at higher energies, and because of this \"There is no Physics\" and scientists have started killing themselves due to despair. This is nonsense.<br /><br />In the real world, Particle Physics has gotten rather boring and predictable. Short of some absurd theoretical results at energies that we can't test experimentally, the Standard Model has tremendous explanatory power and has explained all experiments and predicted new results correctly. CERN discovered the Higgs, as expected, but has brought out no new Physics, thus far. This is disappointing. Much, much more exciting would be a field breaking result, (such as a new, previously unknown, variance of Physics in time and space at higher energies). Particle Physics would be fun again.<br /><br />Similarly, when Wang Miao starts seeing a countdown, instead of jumping to the most likely conclusion (that he is becoming mental ill, and needs outside, non-biased verification of what he is seeing) or that he is receiving messages from some outside intelligence, he starts to go crazy in a very over the top and amateurishly written way."]}

There are several compelling and interesting characters in this book.<br /><br />Above all else the plot, world-building and pacing of the book are completely top notch.  To have a hard sci-fi book that is not about space marines and laser guns but still manages to be a page-turner that you can't put down is an amazing achievement!

I refuse to discuss the plot but if you have an interest in science and technology and love the hard sci-fi genre, stop reading this review and order the book immediately!<br /><br />I will provide one disclaimer.  If you have no interest in science whatsoever or just lack an aptitude or understanding of it, this book series may not be for you.

{"text": ["It's impossible to rate this book on it's own since it's part of a stunning trilogy, and the quality of this book only really shines in the context of the whole. Cixin gets very technical in parts, and descriptions of physics can go on, and on. For that reason, I am glad that I had an audiobook for this one. I'm an academic, and already do a lot of reading, and some sections would start to feel more like work than relaxation. Still, I might have drifted off a little here and there during the most intense technical descriptions, but still paid enough attention to learn a bit about the speed of light, black holes and different dimensions.<br /><br />I also put the series down in the middle of the second book when I realized that there was not a single female character left that was a significant part of the narrative. But, I came back to it eventually, and I'm so glad I did. As it turns out, the 3rd book is largely from a feminine point of view, and thinking back, I'm pretty sure that Cixin was intentionally emphasizing a masculine point of view in the second book.<br /><br />Otherwise, the incredible scope of this book and the sheer audacity of even trying to tell this the story Cixin tells is breathtaking. It even has the quality of a fairy tale, but not a modern Disney version, more like the old dark folk tales of the past. Cixin waxes and wanes from optimism and despair, destruction and renewal and yin and yang throughout. As with life, there is no fairy tale ending, the story just ends when it ends.<br /><br />I'm going to be thinking about this story for many years to come."]}

{"text": ["I don't know if it was the translation or the natural flow of the author, but there were substantial portions of this story that seemed utterly lacking in depth ... the book is riddled with vague and bland descriptions of scenes and actions of characters that made little sense, trite descriptions lacking in color or flavor ... for example there would be passages like &#34;he parked his car and walked to the apartment&#34; ... no descriptions of the scenery around him, no atmosphere, no sounds, no internal monolog to tell us what the character was thinking, just a plain and simple sentence describing a plain and simple action without any environmental scene-setting or any other literary tool to paint a picture for the reader. Perhaps its an aspect of how different Chinese cultural expectations are from ours. Anyhow ... the entire story seemed rather silly to me ... and after seeing all those 4 and 5 star reviews gushing about how intense and deep this story was ... I'm thinking those reviewers must have only ever been exposed to Dr Seuss stories before if they found this book to be deep. It is not deep. It is not masterful. It is not mind-blowing or eye-opening or any of the other superlatives and hyperbolic praise phrases that some reader/reviewers have posted.

{"text": ["It's hard to know where to begin talking about The Three-Body Problem trilogy (officially known as the Remembrance of Earth's Past series), a truly staggering piece of science-fiction written by Chinese author Cixin Liu and translated to English by Ken Liu and Joel Martinsen (Liu did books 1 and 3, while Martinsen did 2). A trilogy that spans literally thousands of years, deals with quantum physics, game theory, sociology, religion, space exploration, space colonization, and more, all driven by the nature of first contact with alien intelligence - there's a lot going on in this series, and that's before you start realizing just how much Cixin (reminder: Chinese names are traditionally written with the family name first and the given name second) truly takes on the advanced science of his ideas. And yet, when you finish it, you realize that you've read something truly incredible - a piece of hard science-fiction whose ambition, scope, richness, and ideas are impossible not to find yourself thinking about for days afterward.<br /><br />The series begins with The Three-Body Problem, which opens during the Chinese Revolution, depicting the conflict between science and politics in stark, honest terms -a theme that the series will grapple with often, in wildly different ways. We flash forward, though, to a near future, where scientists are killing themselves for unclear reasons. What this has to do with the characters from that Revolution-era prologue, a government program attempting to reach out to the galaxy in search of alien intelligence, and a complex computer simulation of a civilization subject to bewildering rules of nature, Cixin takes his time to explain. But what becomes clear quickly is that The Three-Body Problem is, in a way, a novel about first contact, and how humanity will react to a race whose purposes for coming here may not be entirely benevolent.<br /><br />If you're thinking that all of this sounds like a basic setup for an alien invasion novel, rest assured, that is definitely not what you're getting with The Three-Body Problem. Instead, Cixin explores the social implications of such an arrival, and deals head-on with the complex questions that it would cause. Would humanity band together in the face of this, or would our already existing divisions fracture even deeper? Would people be terrified of this advanced race, or would they be viewed as gods? And would people truly feel that humanity is worth saving, or would they welcome a race who could bring out peace, even through subjugation? These aren't simple ideas, but Cixin makes them the meat of the book, along with advanced discussions about the alien planet, which is governed by three suns, leaving their homeworld incapable of safe habitation (the source of the novel's title).<br /><br />More than that, Cixin takes no shortcuts in his story, embracing hard science-fiction as a way of dealing with his scenario. Communication across multiple light-years, limited telescopic technology, the disconnect between human and alien intelligences, relativity, black holes - all of this is relevant to the book, and while Cixin makes it accessible, be aware, this book doesn't spoon feed you its physics. You're going to have to come with some willingness to think about the advanced concepts on display and ponder them, from gravitational forces to quantum computing. It's not pure technobabble, but it's a challenging read at times, and assumes its readers have the willingness to take on its science. <br /><br />If you do, though, what you'll get is a complex, fascinating book about first contact, one that's not quite like anything else I've read in how it handles the questions that such a contact would bring about. And while it's the first book in a trilogy, none of that keeps the book from standing on its own, leaving room for further exploration but existing as a single piece of work that's already remarkable on its own.<br /><br />To explain this series is a difficult challenge, to put it mildly. This is a series that spans a huge amount of time, deals with advanced scientific concepts in complex terms, grapples with rich philosophical and political ideas, debates questions without easy answers, and gives you a scope that can be daunting. It's a story of alien invasions, yes, but one in which the action sequences we're so used to are replaced with existential dread, a rethinking of our own lives, and a fear of the unknown that's hard to quantify. It's also the story of people caught up in these times, trying to give themselves a good life while never forgetting the larger questions of their era, and juggling their own fears with fears for humanity. In other words, it's what hard science-fiction is great at - thoughtful questions, big ideas, and speculation, all of which change the way you think about the world.<br /><br />This series is a truly incredible achievement, one that honestly left me a bit staggered and reeling as I attempt to think about it all, but one that I love all the more for what it accomplishes. If you're a hard science-fiction fan, or simply someone who loves dealing with the complex ramifications of common ideas, this is a must read series. I've never read anything like it in my life, and I'm a richer person for the ideas it's inspired me to think about."]}
{"text": ["Much of what other \"one star\" criticisms say is true. Flat characters. Simplistic writing. The lack of plot sense is the worst disaster. Sometimes at the end of a spy thriller or mystery movie, we forgive some plot gaps for the characters or action sequences or ambience. Here there is little reason to forgive. I plowed through to the end and a few mysteries finally became clear, but there were too many retrospective, \"Hey, that didn't make any sense.\" moments. I am an old hand at science fiction, multiple timelines and plot threads coming together at the last moment. SO, I doubt I \"just didn't get it\". It was mildly interesting to see some Chinese point of view on Mao's Cultural Revolution, which factors in. I didn't walk away thinking \"Hmm, the Chinese take a very different approach to science fiction\" though. Can't see how this even got nominated for any awards unless it was sheer political correctness."]}

The characters are cardboard cartoons.  The technology is an idiotically simple game that 5 year olds would find boring and trite while the users have to outfit themslves in protective gear that has no function.  Remember the moronic paper clip that Windows had way back that kept interrupting you with ridiculous help you didn't want or need?

This Triology is unique in many ways and demonstrates that the author really can think broadly across mankind, time and science.

{"text": ["I feel so sorry for people who are reading this book and don't know enough to spot the massive, glaring problems throughout. There is some value here in that the book is written in part about the Maoist revolution in China, a period many in the West are wonderfully uninformed about. That part is mostly historical, and worth reading. The speculative fiction parts, however, are completely stupid.<br /><br />Yes, I said stupid. Just to give you a feel for why I'd be so strident, let's look at something more people will be familiar with. During the story, a character plays a mysterious video game. There's a throwaway line that the character must complete the game because if you unplug from the game, \"your account will be deleted\". This is so stupid it's jaw-dropping, and I realize a lot of people are going to gloss over this so let's parse through it a bit. 1) So what? You make a new account. A smarter author would therefore say that your account will be suspended meaning you can't keep playing, so let's be nice and assume it's a translation problem. 2) No game works this way, as for instance you could lose your internet connection due to a power outage. It's really bad design to delete the player's account, so this would never be a standard practice as described in the book. 3) The author was just trying to invent a technical-sounding reason for why the character keeps playing this game. How about instead of inventing silly technical mumbo-jumbo, the author could just say the character is really liking the game and wants to see how it ends? It's just forehead-slapping stupidity, not inventive fantasy fiction.<br /><br />The entirety of the main plot thread is also forehead-slapping stupid, but I'd have to get into some spoilers to break that one down. So let me conclude the non-spoiler section by saying this is an interesting book in terms of being written by a Chinese author who uses the backdrop of the Maoist revolution in an interesting manner. If you're up for a light romp with technology and aliens and Maoists, consider this book.<br /><br />SPOILERS BEGIN.<br /><br />The main thread of the plot is a mystery where scientists are looking at experiments from different particle accelerators, and discovering different accelerators give different answers. This leads to a conclusion that the laws of physics are different in different places, which shoots a hole in fundamental theories. Physics is supposed to be the same no matter where you conduct the experiment. Because of this... wait for it... scientists are committing suicide. This is the moment when you hear a loud sigh escaping from anyone who's ever actually done science. This is such a tired trope, claiming that scientists are just religious zealots about their own weird gods in the form of particles - and yes the book explicitly calls scientists religious zealots who can't stand to see their god blasphemed. In the real world, look at all the news reports coming out of the Large Hadron Collider. Everyone has heard about the Higgs Boson or \"god particle\" and how this finally put the final nail in the coffin of many rival theories. Did anyone commit suicide? Was there a conspiracy to cover up the evidence? Maybe there were a couple of nutcases somewhere out there in the world, but generally this did not happen. If particle accelerators were really giving weird new results, scientists would rejoice! The worst day for a scientist is when their result turns out to be boring and expected. It's a lot harder to get funding when your results are just verifying existing theories. If all the accelerators were giving different results, there would be years of work to do first verifying nothing went wrong, then decades of work to see if an underlying cause could be determined. That's a lot of job security! It wouldn't drive anyone at all to suicide.<br /><br />END SPOILERS.<br /><br />A book with a neat premise, that's completely stupid at a fundamental level. Only read it if your brain is going to be firmly in fiction mode where you don't stop to think about the actual real-world physics of anything going on, or else you're going to have a bad headache in short order."]}

I was reminded of the “space operas” of the 1940’s which did the same.  (Yes, I’m that old…) I felt that character development was very thin and that there was a generally infantile air about the whole thing.

{"text": ["What will contact with an interstellar alien civilization bring?  Perhaps more importantly, what will anticipation of contact cause us to do?<br /><br />In an elaborate, thoughtful, somewhat sardonic exploration Cixin Liu, Chinese science fiction writer, with the skillful translation of Ken Liu explores the possibilities in “The Three Body Problem”, the first of his “Remembering Earth’s Past” trilogy (first published in 2006).<br /><br />Situated in China, the story unfolds with a mix of recent 1960s Chinese history and present day events curiously puzzling and suggesting a deeper mystery to be revealed.<br /><br />An unusual military installation atop a remote mountaintop (Red Coast) and a virtual reality game (Three Body) along with an enigmatic countdown sporadically appearing in photographs bring together an assortment of characters trying to figure out what it all means.  It eventually becomes clear another civilization on a planet with three suns (TriSolar) exists in a nearby galaxy and its intentions are unclear.<br /><br />While actual physical contact is way off in the future due to the limits of space-time on travel, snippets of communication allow fantasies to blossom into full blown political movements about future relationships and salvation from current conditions.<br /><br />And as it turns out, these speculations are very active at both ends of the tenuous link between the two systems with wry prospects for “careful what you wish for.”<br /><br />The narrative is related through three perspectives flowing back and forth through past, present and future for dramatic impact:<br /><br />• Ye Wenjie, a female physicist with remarkable abilities including her own survival, through dark periods of red China history;<br />• Wang Miao, a upper middle management nanotechnologist who finds himself in the midst of unusual circumstances requiring his skills;<br />• Princeps, the shadowy leader of the Trisolarans, whose communications transcripts reveal what the \"other\" civilization is contemplating.<br /><br />The storytelling has a dispassionate tone for all its narrators adding its own element of alienation.  There are interesting images of locusts used near the beginning and end of this tale suggesting both plague and survival.  In addition, a lot of constructions seem to get accomplished in a short period of time such as the creation of the mysterious Three Body virtual reality game.  Oh well.<br /><br />One alert: there are several detailed discussions of classic and current physics that may seem intimidating but can be taken as a means to explain how actions can take place within the story.  Just go with the flow and don’t be intimidated.<br /><br />Many of elements and concepts have appeared in other writing: Ray Bradbury’s “The Martian Chronicles “ (1950); Walter Miller Jr.’s “A Canticle for Leibowitz” (1959); Frank Herbert’s “Dune” (1965); most recently, Michio Kaku’s  “The Future of Humanity”(2018) providing insights about the limitation of interstellar civilization contact.<br /><br />For me, the imagery and story of the Red Guard years, its consequences and transition to the present day offer intriguing suggestions about the inscrutable expression and cool distance certain Chinese seem to project.  It offers signposts for our current social frustrations and where they might lead.<br /><br />“Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle little TriSolar.  How I wonder what you are.”"]}

{"text": ["At first I thought this read would be of the historical fiction genre, as it dealt with the Chinese 'cultural revolution' of the early 60s.  Then it turned into Sci Fi.  I found relating to any of the characters difficult, as they seemed oddly incomplete to the point of nearly ethereal.  I attribute that primarily to the author's wanting to move the story along, at the expense of fleshing out the characters.  There were a few 'spoon feeds' by the author, telling the reader what to think, and also a few anachronisms.  These kicked me out of the story for a moment; others may not care either way.<br /><br />The primary story is about a struggle between an organization made up of 'the only good human is a dead human' crowd, roughly comparable to the Gaea worshipers we have running loose in the world today, and those trying to save humanity from both this group and an alien invasion fleet, on their way and due in about 450 years.  This book doesn't detail how they deal with those challenges, although some readers will, based on their knowledge of physics and what the book tells them, discern how to deal with both decisively.  Sadly, this latter group will not be reading the sequels, as they've already figured it out and are unwilling to spend the time or suffer more esoteric shenanigans.<br /><br />Did I enjoy the read?  From a fascinated 'what will the author conjure up next' perspective, I'd say overall that yes, it was enjoyable.  Is it a Hugo award winner?  Yes, but pales in comparison to many others I have read.  Not sure what that says about the book or myself, but there is room in the literary world for all kinds of readers.  And writers."]}
{"text": ["Clearly Cixin Liu is a master of his art, the novel.  I am just grateful that he writes his masterpieces in the field of science fiction.  In some ways this novel is in the mystery genre: What did that mean?  How will this unfold?  What truth lies behind that clue?  In other ways it is a an action novel.  There is no unnecessary violence, but there is action.  In other ways it is a story about relationships, family, friends, good relationships, and broken ones.  It is very well rounded.<br /><br />Ultimately it is about human nature.  Liu's insights into this subject are compelling.  Some of it is by contrasting humans with the alien species.  Some of it is by taking us through human conversations or thought soliloquies.<br /><br />For me as a xenophilic American, probably the most useful thing is the insight it gives into Chinese culture and how recent history impacts that.  It is not a thorough treatise on culture, though -- it is just a novel.  But narratives, for example, set in the Cultural Revolution help me begin to begin getting a better understanding of some things that inform Chinese world view which I never experienced.  The novel walks me through average people's daily lives in a country I have never visited.<br /><br />The translation is also a work of high excellence.  I tweeted Ken Liu congratulating him on this accomplishment.<br /><br />Cixin Liu's work wholly deserves its honor of winning the Hugo Award this year."]}
{"text": ["I loved this trilogy. It is brilliant, and unprecedented at many levels.  It introduces many new concepts, including one that has already become mainstream, the “Dark Forest” explanation for the Fermi Paradox. My first Chinese sci-fi from “... the most prolific and popular science fiction writer in the People's Republic of China.”<br /><br />And boy is it different. American sci-fi brought you Star Trek, The Martian Chronicles, 2001 and a slew of other stories across a spectrum of mostly upbeat themes sprinkled with a few dystopian ones. But nowhere did I encounter anything like this: a stepped-through and exceedingly logical explanation of why everyone and everything that is not of your kind is potentially deadly, and why it’s best to assume the worst from them. Wow. This “takeaway” gave me the chills. It didn’t help that the only American character portrayed to any depth in the trilogy (Ward) was a cold hearted killer. I couldn’t help but wonder if the millions of Chinese readers all thought “Sure, that all makes sense. Better launch a photoid soon” (read the book to understand).<br /><br />The literary tool of jumping ahead centuries while flashing back as needed is masterfully handled. He successfully communicates an Eastern long term perspective to his themes.  He does that by showing how unintended consequences are the rule and not the exception, and that true understanding takes time. No quick answers. It reminded me of the famous answer Mao gave when asked what he thought of the French Revolution: “Its too early to tell”.<br /><br />I read all three back to back and was impressed with his deliberate and unconventional writing style. The pace and venue jump around in a remarkably refreshing way. It’s one of the very best sci-if series I’ve ever read. Maybe the best. Highly recommended. But be patient when you read it- don’t lose interest when the pace slows to grab details in some of the scenes. Every chapter is there for a reason."]}
{"text": ["There are certain elements in the story that are simply too illogical and make it rather difficult to accept its premise. SPOILERS AHEAD so please discontinue reading this review in case you're serious about picking this book up. First of all, how does a fully trained physicist (a materials scientist but still someone who should have taken a course in mechanics) not immediately realise the nature of chaos in the game when its website's name is \"3body.net\"? Why does it take him so long to realise a chaotic system is very sensitive to initial conditions and therefore impossible to predict? Secondly, the alpha centauri system is quite stable and it's highly unlikely that proxima centauri (being some 13000 AU from the AB system barycenter) will ever participate in chaotic motion as described in the book. Even if it did, the system would be unstable enough to eject one or more stars before spending billions of years (giving sufficient time) for carbon based life forms to repeatedly form civilizations. The AB system should have long become red giants before any of that. Thirdly, how the hell is a civilization capable of \"unfolding\" a proton to create a supercomputer \"etched on it\" and not able to simply kick out two of their stars out of the system or simply propel their planet along with the closest star away from the other two? Absolutely ridiculous."]}
{"text": ["Okay, let's do this. I've got 2 degrees, an IQ number to be proud of and a decent background in science fiction. So, I think I can offer up a review of this book despite some of my time within it spent in the Baffleverse.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br /> - It takes a while to manifest, but the plot finally develops over the last - hmm - 25%-30% of the book. Once its form coalesces, you should find yourself nodding silently as you finish up this first book of a trilogy.<br /> - This book throws out concepts by the bucketful. Fascinating and sometimes overwhelming, there's enough to mentally chew on throughout the tale to keep active minds engaged.<br /> - Science Fiction and Speculative Fiction, always a fun combo. It's not just about extraordinary events interfacing with humanity, it's also about the psychology of humanity as it attempts to interface with said extraordinary events. This path is probably the book's shining feat. (What I used to call socio-science fiction, back in my John Brunner days).<br /> - Unique characters that afford a nice swath of the human condition. This allows the writer to explore human perspectives from various points of views. Smart.<br /><br />The not so good:<br /><br /> - As some have mentioned, character development is in short supply. The \"lead\" in this book is the science. The supporting character is societal change. Oh, and there are also some humans in the book, too, but they are too often simple tools for plot movement or exposition. None are developed to the point where the reader gains a relationship with them. The book definitely has an \"outside looking in\" feel to it.<br /> - Chinese names. Let's just get it out of the way. I couldn't imagine, after decades of reading science fiction with all those strange alien names, that Chinese names would prove so distracting early on in the book. Perhaps knowing they were \"real\" names made the difference. In any case, the distraction fades after a while, but in an already difficult to get started book, that doesn't help.<br /> - The aforementioned slow start. I freely admit, my \"hardest\" science fiction experience was basically Larry Niven. This stuff is a (no pun intended) quantum leap into incomprehensible, at least for a non-science major like me. Fortunately, a lifetime of science fiction and some good guesswork enabled me to at least grasp the sense of the science, but, especially at the beginning, not so much fun.<br /><br />Overall, I like the book on several levels. I bemoan the lack of characterization (a problem Niven seemed to share...I wonder if that's endemic to \"hard science\" science fiction writers). There was enough entertainment for me to consider exploring the second book of the trilogy."]}
{"text": ["China 1967, Earth. Mao Tse Tung is in power, but factions inside the communist party are in disagreement even up to armed conflict. This is the background, while the story revolves around physicists. Over the next 40 years, China while rejecting theoretical physics, gains strength in applied research. Even though physicists keep committing suicide.<br /><br />Oh, but the story is really about \"Three Body\" a modern virtual reality game that entrances players to the point of death. Oh, wait again, this is a science fiction novel and it's REALLY about another planet far far away.<br /><br />Maybe you can tell that I cannot come up with a good way to explain this novel, a winner of the prestigious Hugo Award for 2015. The lead-in is looooong; the plot doesn't really get going until page 172. But in the meantime, and as it gets going, the historical and astronomical and physics background is pretty interesting. What it all leads up to, final cataclysm, is revealed gradually, and is a great science fiction premise.<br /><br />On the plus side, the writing in \"The Three Body Problem\" is intelligent and the basic premise of the \"three bodies\" and its application to a real life situation is very interesting. The way the author brings together different threads is well done, though occasionally confusing. On the minus side, for me, is that there is too much background, lots of extraneous \"stuff\" that, though creatively written, is long-winded as well as entangled.<br /><br />\"The Three Body Problem\" is the first in Cixin Liu's \"Remembrance of Earth's Past\" trilogy. I may have to gather my strength before reading the 2nd, \"The Dark Forest\", because this first one was hard work and a bit depressing.<br /><br />Happy Reader"]}
{"text": ["I have been reading science fiction since I was 8. That was 1960, the year Stranger in a Strange Land was published. [Didn’t read it until 1969] While I concede that I haven’t read everything, that covers many, many, many wonderful books and some lessers ones too. I read Dune at Woodstock. The dried mud is still on it. That includes Hyperion all the way up to Peter Hamilton. Otherland by Tad Williams is another classic. I work in the criminal justice system and Greg Bear’s Queen of Angels is staggering. I could go on and on but you get the point. I just finished The Three Body Problem and the 2 sequels. All 3 took a total of a week. To borrow a hackneyed  expression, I just couldn’t put them down. Mr. Liu is a towering talent. Magnificent. Very few could conceive of such a tale and have the unparalleled talent to write it. I could not recommend it more highly. As an afterthought, The Dark Forest concept was also addressed by Greg Bear in the Forge of God and the Anvil of Stars. If you enjoyed this as much as I have you should read those as well. You wonder if Mr. Liu has read them, but that detracts not at all from this immediate classic.He takes it in another direction entirely. Read it!!! That's one exclamation for each book."]}
{"text": ["The story line was original and interesting but the character development was very lacking.  Little attempt was made to describe the impact of major tragic events on character's thought and emotion or how it drove their actions.  It may be due to cultural differences.  On the other hand, the author takes an enormous amount of time describing computer systems and code.  Much of the discussion is repetitive and slows the story down.  The narration is mostly good but detective in the story is made to sound like a crusty big city american cop and it seems out of place for a story set in China."]}
{"text": ["Cixin Liu is a genius! I am in awe that such depth and perspective comes from one mind. Not only is the science completely believable, but the characters are personal and human. In addition, the book is poetic, too. I've never read better hard SF, and I've read lots of it. This trilogy is easily in my top five books I've read."]}
{"text": ["This book is extraordinary.  The author has a deft touch with the unexpected blend of hard science and deeply felt human emotions.  My (admittedly limited) experience with Chinese literature did not quite prepare me for the rhythm of the book, where not a word is wasted and the story moves quickly while burning a path through your brain.<br /><br />A story of profound ideas told simply and sparingly, the reader is invited to feel the fear building from the first page.  The words of post-modern ugliness and hate are countered by slim moments of beauty and hope, with both the hate and the beauty betrayed and betraying by turn.  These complex ideas, along with laws and theories of physics, are presented in words so exact and poetic that the reader is just swept along for the ride of a lifetime.<br /><br />My two favorite moments from the book: in a virtual reality setting when a body long ago burned at the stake is identified as Giordano Bruno without further commentary and the concept of spooky quantum entanglement as providing a real time vision of actions across light years.<br /><br />I thank the author and his talented translator for this work.  My own limited imagination has been freshly awakened thanks to the powerful imaginations behind this amazing story.  For a split second, I could actually visualize the happenings in the particle accelerator as the scientists were driven toward madness.  I am so grateful to have read this extraordinary book"]}

{"text": ["Unlike anything I have ever read. It feels strange to make such a statement considering I’ve read a lot in almost every genre. The Three Body Problem by Cixin Liu should appeal to hard core science fiction enthusiasts, especially those interested in physics and astrophysics, but it also weaves in fascinating information about the Cultural Revolution and its lasting impact on modern China, makes excellent use of familiar stereotypes in unexpected ways, and creates suspense seemingly out of nothing more than scientific curiosities.  I could try to describe the problem of the three bodies, but would fail miserably, and in the process potentially ruin some of the subtleties of the problem as it manifests itself throughout the novel. One could argue that the novel’s distinctiveness stems from being written in Chinese. But I suspect that its complexity and uniqueness occur despite the translation rather than because of it. After all, the language of math and physics is universal. Or is it?

{"text": ["I wasn't sure what I was in for but was absolutely delighted. The portrayals of fhe Cultural Revolution are poetic and chilling. The science and story are well balanced and the story is as complex as I've come to expect of Chinese literature. The characters many are calling &#34;flat&#34; and &#34;cardboard&#34; aren't that so much as they represent archetypes found throught the history of Chinese mythology and writing. Going into this Westerners need to understand that this was not a book written with them at the forefront. It's a Chinese story, written for the Chinese reader, translated to maintain the integrity of mode of thought and cultural touchstones. Dear American, this was not written for you, it is being shared with you. One doesn't need to necessarily understand all this thoroughly to appreciate it anymore than one needs an in depth understanding of any made up alien culture in any other science fiction novel. You don't need to be a scholar of Chinese history to get it. I enjoyed the mirroring toward the end, showing the alien mind as not much different than our own and that experiences can be universal.<br /><br />This is very much story driven with the science playing a major role, however there's no need to have a PhD in astrophysics to get that the 3 Body Problem is a Bad Thing for the Trisolarians. I found both the science *and* the science fiction to be solid. My general measure for this is whether or not I feel the need to put the book down in order to look up anything that strikes me as just plain wrong. The cables suspending my disbelief didn't snap so I was able to enjoy the story."]}
{"text": ["A writer friend of mine pressed this book upon me unequivocably, mentioning in passing that one of the book's biggest fans was Barack Obama. How could I refuse?<br />It was unfortunate that I was, when I started The Three-Body Problem, in the afterglow of having read the latest and best novel from the planet's greatest living novelist, Javier Marias, Berta Isla. A pretty tough act to follow, to say the least.<br />So I must be forgiven for perhaps being less than generously disposed to prose that limps off the page, at best, and at worst, whose characters aspire to caricature and cardboard. The extra-terrestrials? When revealed, they're just like us, only duller.<br />As fiction, stultifyingly dull and clueless. As Science Fiction, though, in terms of high concept, science-philosophical queries, fractal insights spanning the multi-various universes, nested enormities of dimensions, intergalactic espionage as subverting our own grasp of reality and potential scientific progress?<br />We can all name Sci-Fi writers who used speculative fiction for merely satirical ends, or writers who drape a multiverse in empyrean thought and inspiring, deeply artful prose. The 21st Century's best trilogy has already been written, with reality in all its multiplicity as a mere starting point: Alan Moore's Jerusalem. There are plenty of novels of the undead to amuse, but there's only one Green Eyes by the late Lucius Shepard. SciFi can cast a fantastical speculative vision of the future, but at its best, with Philip K. Dick, Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke and a host of others, an inward glance into the microcosm of the soul, of the heart, is also possible. As fiction, The Three-Body Problem is at best, amateurish. On the Science level of grasp, probity and vision, this is the masterpiece everyone says it is.<br />I bet this trilogy will make a much better movie than the paper version. Even with my caveats, I'll be reading the rest, just for the occasional mind-blowing, universe-winking-right-at-you stuff."]}
{"text": ["An interesting book, and well translated, something important for me. I listened to the audiobook and thought the reader was good. However, the ideas in the book definitely took precedence over the characters. I barely had time to get to know one character before the point of view and historical period changed, so that individual character arcs were swamped by the ideas the author wanted readers to understand. Physics is not my strong suit, so I found the most interesting chapters of the book were the video game sections in the world of  Trisolaris. These had action, crisis and world-building, and left me wanting to find out what happened next. But I don’t think I’m interested enough to read book two.<br />I also wondered how much of the book was an allegory based on the current leadership of China. Are *they* the real existential threat to the people of China? Many writers living under oppressive regimes use fiction (especially sci-fi) to talk about current real-life conditions.

{"text": ["Cixin Liu is a multi-award winning science fiction whose works are now available in English translation.  This is the first in a planned trilogy.  The novel begins during the time of China’s Cultural Revolution.  Academics are being purged and forced to undergo Communist indoctrination.  One area remains untouched, that of science as China is planning a project to contact aliens from outer space.  Ye Wenjie had watched her scientist father being beaten to death; yet by a strange series of circumstances, she is chosen to be part of this new team to reach outer space.  This is truly hard science fiction.  Even though the science of astrophysics is hard to follow, one can skip some of the scientific descriptions and still get the gist of the plots herein.  At first the problems with the project are that Wenjie and her colleagues are studying scientific theory, they discover that eventually all past theories become negated by the new ones.  Physics, Biology and Computer Science are omitted after their use has become negated by technology leaps.<br />The Red Coast Project is highly secure with a classified rating.  Wang Miao has been invited to be part of the project even though his field of nanotechnology is totally unrelated to this problem.  Wang has a problem getting others to answer his questions.  What he learns is mostly from what originally was a virtual reality game called Three Body which involves discovering and eventually the renunciation of these same theories by Newton, Von Neumann, the First Zhou Emperor, Syzygy, etc.<br />Suddenly, the Three Body game is no longer a game but a connection with Extraterrestrial beings, the Trisolaran Fleet.  Instead of being excited, the scientists become divided in factions.  The proverbial problem is after the discovery, what are these beings like and can Chinese plans fuse with the Trisolaran beings?  Will the latter reform human civilization, the goal being the elimination of all human madness and evil?  Will the Earth be destroyed?  Yours to be discovered!<br />The author includes a postscript in which he describes how his interest in science and scientific theory developed which is clear and interesting to follow.<br />All in all, this is a difficult text to read but contains ideas about science and scientists and humanity that is sure to intrigue fans of hard core science fiction.  It certainly will provoke much dialogue about its theories, plots and plans for future novels in the series!"]}

The main plot twist, a dramatic and beautiful one, is revealed about three quarters in, and it would be interesting to see if the reader can grasp it before that point. But with this edition, you don't get to experience that, because the back cover gives it away, indeed spells it out prominently. Why that is, and who thought that would be a good idea, is a mystery.<br />I strongly recommend the book, but don't know what to tell you - buy the hard copy and try to avoid seeing what is written in large characters on it? get an audio version instead?

But where this book really falls down is its writing, and this is not just related to the fact that the book is translated from another language.<br /><br />There are a lot of small problems, but the one that is most jarring is that the book drifts off into incredibly long passages of exposition that choke any life or action out of the narrative. Indeed, some characters seem to exist fairly transparently for the purposes of providing exposition. Many books do this, of course, but there are ways of making it a little less obvious and it begins to grate fairly quickly in this case. The writer seems to take the mantra of \"show, don't tell\" and deliberately reverse it, even to the point where it seems to be instructing the reader as to how they should think or feel about events of the book.<br /><br />This is not the worst thing I've read, not by a country mile.

But these add tones that make the story less fantasy and more realism. The Chinese cultural revolution plays an important role here and that adds an interesting dimension.<br /><br />\"Yes was strongly against nuclear war. She knew this was a power that should belong only to the stars.\"<br /><br />The story seems told in an odd fashion, with much exposition that doesn't really lend a lot to the story, followed by a relatively brief narration of the main plot told as a recollection. The translator's notes mention there are aspects of Chinese novels that will seem unusual to a western reader, and he strove to preserve that character. So I attribute this seemingly odd story telling to a cultural difference. It isn't necessarily a negative. In fact it lends an exotic flavor to the novel."]}

The motivations of the characters are like something from a kid's imagination of why grown ups do things.  Obviously, the author touched on something that people like, or they wouldn't buy it.

One chapter starts from the perspective of a spider crawling up a gravestone, while two of the characters are standing in front of it talking... which I thought was an extremely original way to advance the story and put an image in my head that I will carry with me forever.

The pace picked up again towards the end, as the conspiracy came together. I was not totally convinced by the premise of that conspiracy, but I am now hooked on the story.

Those who want fast-paced, action-movie-esque sci-fi will not be happy with this book. However, I -- and those to whom I have recommended it -- have found it thoroughly enjoyable.

I rushed through it a bit during my first read, but after the story starts to introduce the truly monumental concepts about cosmic sociology in the second and third books, I had to re-read it.

Not only is this science fiction, but it is also an excellent history lesson for those interested in the Chinese Cultural and Communist Revolutions.<br /><br />As one story thread deals with the present day, and pending alien encounter, another has its basis in the Chinese Cultural Revolution.  The threads come together quite well in the end.  But, of course, it is not the end, as this is the first book of a trilogy.<br /><br />UPDATE AFTER READING VOLUME TWO: Do yourself a favor and read this book, if only to provide the background necessary to appreciate the second book of the trilogy, The Dark Forest.

In many ways, it as similar to some of the work of Ursula LeGuin, who excelled in what I might refer to as sociological or anthropological science fiction.  Definitely worth a read and I will proceed to the second book of the trilogy."]}
{"text": ["I learned of this book in an article I was reading about Chinese Science Fiction. Cixin Liu was described as the Chinese Arthur C. Clarke in the article, and it mentioned his Remembrance of Earth's Past Trilogy specifically. Intrigued (as I've long been a fan of Clarke), I downloaded the book to my Kindle. The book is incredible and I see where the comparisons to Clarke come from. Like Clarke, Cixin Liu can take seemingly dense and insurmountable scientific concepts and explain them in such a way that you are able to fully grasp the concept. The writer (and the translator) did an excellent job in holding the reader's interest as, layer by layer, the mystery at the center of this volume is uncovered. It is the best Sci-Fi novel I've read in years. I look forward to many more works from Cixin Liu in the future."]}
{"text": ["I am not a fan of science fiction, but after hearing of all the rave reviews of this book, I decided to give it a go.<br />I found the overall plot with its historical background to be extremely fascinating. It was quite a journey going back and forth between two timelines and answering a question that all of us want to know: &#34;What would we, humanity, do if we encountered aliens?&#34;<br />I became captivated by the premise as it was something I have never read before. However, the execution of this idea along with its historical and interstellar journey for the audience was extremely lackluster.<br />I've read many translated books before and I felt like this translation was clear, but unnatural. Perhaps that was a factor towards why the execution was not as amazing as what the idea was. There were dull moments that became difficult to read through and I felt like the transitions between the present, the past, and the game did not follow a steady pace. I really wanted to like this, but I do not see myself reading the rest of this trilogy."]}
{"text": ["When I put this book down I was equal parts depressed and blown away. It is wholly original, a great mixture of hard (really hard) science fiction, political intrigue, and social commentary. Liu has opened up a virtual factory of incredible, original SF ideas in this book, and, I assume, in the remainder of the series.<br /><br />I will admit that I had trouble getting into this novel at first, both because it starts out quite slowly and stays slow for most of its length. Also, particularly for readers not familiar with the Chinese Cultural Revolution,  it can be challenging keeping the characters and their motivations straight. This is certainly not the author's fault.<br /><br />Put in the work for the first 3/4 of this novel - the last 50-75 pages are a payoff worth waiting for and contain the most humbling and scary explanation for the Fermi Paradox and reason to STOP LOOKING FOR E.T. RIGHT NOW that I've ever read.<br /><br />Four stars because I feel I missed a lot of the characterization - but if I were handing out stars for pure, unadulterated science fiction IDEAS, the Amazon limit of 5 would not be enough."]}
{"text": ["I was curious about reading Chinese science fiction and this had great reviews, so I bought it. The translator has done an excellent job; the book reads as if it was originally written in English. It is interesting to learn about the political context of science in China, but the story itself drags a little. I'm glad I read it, but am not tempted to read any more by this writer."]}
{"text": ["I've heard so many good things about this series, but I also hear \"it gets better, you just have to get through the first book\". After completing \"The Three Body Problem\" my only thought is I can't wait to finish writing this review so I can buy the next book and continue this amazing story. Expertly done translation as well if anyone is worried about that. Reading Chinese names took some getting used to but after the story grabbed me everything else faded into the background and I couldn't stop reading."]}
{"text": ["Where do I start? The scale of this three book saga is just so large that it'll keep you awake at night, dreaming about the stars when you finally sleep and question the existence of everything around you when you're back up.<br />It starts during the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution and ends at a ten dimensional multiverse.<br />I cannot fathom how Liu Cixin is able to take theories from hard fiction and spin them into something that goes far beyond what a normal mind can see.<br />Can't wait for the next one. If you're even remotely interested in sci-fi, please do read this one."]}
{"text": ["THE..... one to beat. The most beautiful writing I’ve ever been exposed to. Breathtaking. All three books are a must. It has risen the bar and I am now expecting high standards of all writings since. What fantastic places I’ve seen. What amazing laws of physics I’ve been subjected to. What crisp and interesting characters I’ve met. And last but not least,... what a vast distance I’ve travelled.... just from reading this trilogy... all else pales in comparison and I should just stop reading . Lol. No. But , wow! What an amazing story. The translation is what amazes me. Does this book sound so intricate and beautiful in its native writ? More so? Wow. Those people must have had to lay down for a week or so just to come down from the trip. Please.... read these. We will be in a better place if all shared in the content of these books."]}
{"text": ["I was very interested to learn how SF from China might be different than what I typically read.  Clearly, the political sections of the book and the effects on individuals is much different from what a US citizen or scientist would have experienced during that same period.  I think the translator did a pretty good job of making the story flow syntactically while still maintaining a Chinese temperament.<br /><br />As to the science, there were a number of new areas of speculation that presented visually memorable aspects of higher dimension (string) theory. The development of digital human computation was original and very unique!  On the other hand, nano wire had me thinking about AC Clarke and Niven.  It has been done before.<br /><br />All in all, quite a good piece of work for those who like hard science fiction.  I've gone on to buy the second novel in the series."]}
{"text": ["(Cross-post from GoodReads) This book was pretty awesome.  At first the book didn't seem like sci-fi, but more like historical fiction set in China's Cultural Revolution.  I like historical fiction too but it thew off my expectation of a sci-fi book at first.  I thought I knew a fair amount about the modern Chinese history because I took a class when I did a summer abroad in Shanghai. But actually after reading the book I realized I didn't know that much because I didn't even know the difference between the People's Liberation Army and the Red Guard.  So I learned some history from the book and also some science and technology as well as some philosophical ideas.  I do computer stuff as a profession and I've started getting into amateur radio and those parts of the sci-fi in the book seem to be believable and well thought out. The other science and technology aspects that I'm less familiar with also seem to be believable too (it's sci-fi so of course you need to stretch what's believable). I enjoyed the cultural/historical and science/tech details, but I'm sure it might not be for everyone.  Even though I know Chinese a bit, it was sometimes difficult to keep track of the names (though not as difficult as the Russian/French names in War and Peace), but I saw that the paperback version has a list of characters (Kindle does not).  If someone were not familiar with Chinese name order and nickname conventions (e.g. &#34;Da Shi&#34; and and &#34;Xiao Wang&#34;), it might be harder to keep track of the characters. But to me the historical/cultural and scientific/technical details made the book a pleasantly challenging learning experience. I'm eager to start the 2nd book..."]}
{"text": ["[No spoilers] This is a review of the entire Three-body Trilogy, \"The Three Body Problem\", \"The Dark Forest\" and \"Death's End\".<br /><br />If you thought you'd read all the best sci-fi ever, add this one to your list. After you've read Asimov's Foundation series, and every Iain Banks Culture novel, what else is going to impress? I'm glad to add this trilogy to that mental list of the best of the best. Epic, but with continuity of characters, human, but also social, with a wonderful writing style (even as a translation) to boot.Just wonderful."]}
{"text": ["I stumbled across this book while foraging for new word-prey for my kindle. Of course, if I start a book in a series, I basically am committing myself to reading all of them, regardless of how much I like them. Since this book is but a piece of the whole story spread across these three books, I honestly find it difficult to remember what exactly happens when. So, I must review it as a single story.<br /><br />The wonder and fascination that this story created for me took me back to those early days when I had just \"discovered\" Asimov, Clarke, etc. I've found it increasingly difficult to come across new books that aren't just about space battles with military groups gunning for whatever cause is at hand. This story is like walking down a boat ramp, you get submerged into this universe in a gradual/reasonable manner, and before you know it, you're thoroughly submerged in an incredible exploration of this \"what if...\"<br /><br />I must recommend partaking in this story."]}
{"text": ["It's not unusual for hard science novels to completely lack character development, but the shear amount of hard science being thrown around also prevents a clear plotline. Like other reviewers, I don't know if it's a translation issue or simply an overreliance of science in place of key writing cornerstones."]}
{"text": ["I'm over 50% through the book and I just can't finish it.  I feel like nothing has happened except for a lot of dry, astrophysics and mathematics.  Do you have to be a scientist to enjoy this?  Even if you read some 4 star and 5 star reviews they say this isn't a page turner, it just changed the way they look at the world.  Or that the first book is good when taken as a whole after reading the trilogy.  Well I definitely will not be doing that.  I'm sure the whole thing is a metaphor but I just don't get it and I'm ok with that."]}
{"text": ["I was very pleasantly surprised with just how much I enjoyed this book. I had heard good reviews but I was concerned that a translated book from a different cultural background might be a difficult read. I was very wrong.<br />I have \"survival level\" familiarity with mandarin. I could feel the pattern of that language under the translation but the reading was smooth and easy. There are plenty of footnotes for cultural references that enhance the book.<br />But best of all, besides being well written/translated, the story is compelling and full of imagination. The author takes science fact, adds some science fantasy (discoverys not yet made, perhaps) and extrapolates them into a thoroughly original alien contact story. Saying much more about the originality and extrapolation would risk spoilers.<br />Highly recommended!"]}
{"text": ["Dark and depressing this book was a big disappointment. Having been an S.F. reader for over 60 years, it worries me that such a pessimistic view of humanity could gain so many kudos. Tho I found the study of the machinations of communist China's bureaucracy interesting, none of the characters was relatable so the human element needed to keep me interested was missing. It was a study in how authoritarian regimes suppress the human spirit and ultimately became such itself. I originally purchased the whole trilogy for myself as my husband. His report that it gets worse in the 2nd two volumes get worse I've concluded it will be a desperate day in a parched dearth of reading material before I continue the trilogy."]}
{"text": ["This three book series is a Commitment. The books are long, full, and make you think. The writing is superb and the style reminds me of the instructions my Sumi painting teacher gave me. \"Before you start, decide what time of year it is, what time of day it is and what the weather is like\". The book really puts you in the moment in each scene and the subsequent books as well. I am well in to the third book, and I'm a very fast reader, and yet my Kindle is saying I still have over 11 hours of enjoyment in the last volume. I've learned a lot about Chinese culture and politics and the philosophical points made really make you think. Thank goodness for the great footnotes! I recommend the series but be ready to commit to reading, thinking, then reading and thinking some more."]}
{"text": ["It's rare that a science fiction book bores me, but this one does.  I'm halfway through this book, the first in the trilogy, and it has become dull.  And I think I can already see the ending.  The story is full of brilliant science and it's obviously well researched, but is repetitious plotting, with an obvious outcome, a thing in China?  I also started to watch \"The Wandering Earth\" on Netflix (or is it Amazon?), and I'm seeing amazing visuals, great science, a cool set of characters ... but how many times do these people need to wander back and forth across the landscape?  Cut from the chases, already.  I put that on pause about 2/3 of the way through and haven't gone back."]}
{"text": ["Mind blowing,just finished reading it! I highly recommend this book to any one.Before I started reading it, I thought it will be a book with highly technical details.But, the book is a murder mystery first, a story about human condition next and keeps you in suspense through out .Even when there are technical concepts, its explained in such a simple manner that anyone can understand.Kudos to the author Cixin Liu and also to the English translator Ken Liu who did such an incredible job.<br />I devoured the book in about 4 days and already ordered the 2nd and 3rd part as well.The last part of the trilogy is not yet out , will be out on Sep 20 2016 and is on pre-order.

{"text": ["A fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable read, &#34;The Three-Body Problem&#34; is an unquestioned success in the otherwise very uneven genre of &#34;hard physics science-fiction&#34;. Filled with history, aliens and celestial mechanics, this novel very much offers something for everyone. The quality of the translation is superb, straddling the conversion into idiomatic English when needed, while still often also preserving the Chinese way of thinking and expressing oneself.<br /><br />Where Greg Egan fell short with &#34;The Clockwork Rocket&#34; and &#34;Incandescence&#34; in trying to introduce too much complex physics, &#34;The Three-Body Problem&#34; succeeds. Here the underlying science passes muster whether you're an expert physicist or a casual reader, because this is a strong story-driven novel. I'm very much looking forward to the English-language release of the sequel in the coming months."]}
{"text": ["This is a great science fiction novel. The writer is obviously very educated and imaginative. I liked how he blends science with social forces (Chinese communism) to slowly unfold a dystopia in the making. This is not your basic shallow thriller-type book; it is more demanding and disturbing than that. Think Stanislaw Lem with more entertainment. The ending of this novel left me wanting to read the sequels, but I'll need some time to build up my energy."]}
{"text": ["Chinese Scifi, well I thought I would try it and see what it was like. Different. The themes it explores are not the sorts of things you generally see in western scifi. Its all about loyalty and trust, and betrayal. When you think about the history of China with the revolution and all that makes sense. In some ways the book feels a little naïve, but it was a pretty good read. I enjoyed the very different perspective on things to think about, and it presented some pretty fun problems.<br />If you are looking for a good scifi book that's different from your typical read, this is worth a go. I have bought the second one but not read it yet. Hoping it continues to develop well. If nothing else, this is not predictable."]}
{"text": ["Woah. This is one of the most complex, intense sci-fi novels I have ever read. TBP takes a deep dive into particle physics, framing its analysis of elementary science both within and outside of the surreal world of the Three Body video game. We are plunged into an expansive mystery which weaves questions about the fundamental fabric of matter through a morally grey tapestry, and we emerge hanging on a cliff edge as the whole world opens up before us. One book down, two to go. I’ll be holding my breath through this series."]}

I have re-read both the first two twice already--like a drug, just amazing plot line, and you actually learn some mathmetic perspective and physics perspective and Chinese world view perspective, making the a true 'literary' read (Note I am in no way a 'literature' person, just widely read.  The first two books in this trilogy have re-ignited my sci fi appetite--I feel like a wondrous teen again.  The book is challenging at times, changes pace a lot and has some marvelous descriptions like when the old policeman smokes in meetings--I hate smoke and smoking and feel sick when he describe the meetings!  Joy, Joy, Read, Read Read this one!"]}
{"text": ["What would happen if China were to have received an alien communication during the tumultuous times of the Cultural Revolution? Political espionage, murder, intrigue, and a strange computer game that’s a little more than it seems. The aliens are on their way, and the actions of a few key characters could either reign down destruction on the human race or save Earth from the coming storm.<br /><br />In the interim, scientists around the world are committing suicide. Wang Miao, a nanotechnology researcher, begins to see a countdown materialize first on developed film, then on his own retinas! What does any of this mean? You'll have to wait 'till the end for the big reveal.<br /><br />Impressions:<br /><br />This book is different from anything I’ve ever read. First, it’s helpful to know that the author, before turning to writing, was an engineer at a power plant in China. That background is obvious in the themes of the book. Physics, engineering, and computer science are key aspects of the novel, but all are presented in a way that a novice in those subjects, like me, could understand. If you like any of subjects, you’ll be enthralled.<br /><br />Secondly, keep in mind that this was written by a Chinese author. As such, the writing is likely to be very different from anything you’ve encountered before if you’ve never read other Asian works, as was the case with me. The dialogue felt very strange at first, akin to what you might encounter in anime. The way the story is conveyed can seem strange, due to minute differences in the writing style between cultures. And, even though the translation is great, there are likely subtle shifts in meaning and style that are present. That’s not to say the writing isn’t good; it just takes some getting used to. The translator addresses this directly in a postscript, saying that literary styles are different between Chinese and English-speaking cultures. At times, he tried to smooth over the differences, but other times he left those differences so as not to subtract from the story or meaning.<br /><br />The novel also initially takes some dedication. The first half of the novel moves somewhat slowly and can be a bit confusing. There were aspects, like the computer program that plays a key role in the beginning, that I wish he’d have explained more. But once you’ve finished the first 200 page hurtle, things start to make sense, and the sinister plot begins to unravel. I’m generally not a fan of science fiction novels, but this one really captivated me."]}
{"text": ["Story is a bit disjointed but keeps interest. I was in China not too long after Tiananmen, testify to what a huge screw up the great leap forward was to the educated elite and to the country was in general. (Beijing has no birds because all the trees were cut down and the wood used to smelt pot metal from everyone's aluminum and brass and iron implements so Mao's China would become a manufacturing competitor). Anyway the everyday news is so so dark, and this story doesn't do a whole lot to brighten it up, but where there is hope and tech, maybe we have a chance. At least we all pull together to try to make it happen in the three body problem. Nice scientific references to historical thinking about gravity and quantum realm."]}
{"text": ["It's really that simple: this is not good reading.  Oh sure, the author is brilliant and his knowledge of physics and astronomy is vast but that doesn't mean he's a good fiction writer.  It's like if Einstein wrote a novel but it was a dud.  Would people have the courage to say that?  I finished the book mostly because I'm a cheapskate and since I bought it.... Well, you understand.  Suffice to say, I won't be purchasing the next 2 books.<br />There is one thing redeeming this book:  the references to the Cultural Revolution and to modern day eco-zealots show how easily people slip into absolutes, excesses, intolerance and even violence."]}
{"text": ["I found myself enjoying the historical setting of the novel as much as I enjoyed the science fiction part of it. I don't read much fiction set in this very different world of recent Chinese history and it is itself a frightening and alien world that the author then reflects back into the larger universe. The prose is unadorned and 'thriller like' - fast paced and not really literary. This might be a conscious effect that the translator wanted to convey or a limit of the translation. Word usage also seems a bit odd at times (I noticed it particularly in the choice of words used to describe human reactions to events - people are sometimes 'amazed' by the oddest things and with little warning, for instance!). But as scheduled envelope fiction it works well, bringing alive the possibility of an unimaginable world and people, as well as unimaginable technology. I do wish some of the unimaginable technology was left a bit more mysterious rather than 'fleshed out' since it is not particularly meaningful, but that's an authors prerogative I guess.  Overall, an enjoyable, quick read."]}
{"text": ["This is one of the best sci-fi series I have ever read. It is complex and introduces a new view on when humans start to expand into the universe. It has truly alien perspective in the way it reflects the world of the 'others'. This has in-depth science, well-developed characters, political intrigue and lots of surprises. The only thing I struggled with were the Chinese names, which I had to write down on a little cheat sheet. I really wish they would add an appendix of the characters. The 'x-ray' in kindle doesn't cut it. The translation for this book is outstanding. You would never know it was from Chinese text. I'm an hour away from finishing the series (my treat this afternoon) and I am sad to end the series. This series is a meaningful contribution to the genre and will no doubt become a classic. I hope Mr. Liu keeps writing!"]}
{"text": ["This is an excellent and thrilling science-fiction novel. As a science-fiction fan I was excited to read science-fiction from a Chinese author intended for Chinese audiences. However, I was disappointed by the carelessness of the translation, including poor grammar, redundancy, typographical errors, and poor copy editing.<br /><br />I would not let the spotty quality of the translation dissuade you from purchasing and enjoying this book. And it's certainly possible that important qualities of the translation are lost on me as someone who does not speak Chinese. However, the problems are a distraction and should have been corrected by now."]}
{"text": ["This is my first step into hard sci fi and after a few chapters of The Three Body Problem, I knew I’d jumped into the deep end.<br /><br />While I enjoyed reading the book and having the story unfold, I had some issues with the book. One, most of the book is a large info dump. Those who are interested on how the science works will be happy with this book. Eventually, the science info dumps feel a bit pretentious, but I didn’t have trouble reading and understanding them. Two, this is a Chinese novel and reads that way. The prose can sound stiff when I’m used to English novels, add the science and it can feel like a text book. It feels alien to this western reader, and perhaps that’s a good thing for such a book. Three, the character development in lackluster, with the exception of the antagonist.<br /><br />However, there are a lot of books with deep character development and not enough that really delve into technical details. This book serves the purpose it sets out to serve and does it very well.<br /><br />I will definitely be picking up the second novel in this series."]}
{"text": ["This is the most innovative science fiction I've read in a long time.  Although the storyline can be a bit hard to follow because it jumps around a bit, the overall effect is compelling and a bit haunting.  I am looking forward to reading the next books in the trilogy.<br /><br />If I have one nitpick it is that the Chinese names can be difficult to follow for Westerners, just as I imagine Western names are for Chinese readers.  The \"cast of characters\" at the front was incomplete.  It would be helpful to have all the characters included. A good reminder for all writers who seek to have an international audience."]}
{"text": ["I ended up enjoying this book, but the first 200 pages were a bit of a slog to get through. This is definitely a great example of ideas-over-all-else in literature. The Three-Body Problem is highly conceptual and can be quite dry. The last quarter of the book pulls everything together nicely and did leave me intrigued about the last two installments in the trilogy.<br /><br />Pros: interesting tidbits about the Chinese Cultural Revolution; thought-provoking ideas regarding humanity & physics<br /><br />Cons: 2D characters; cold tone; slow pacing<br /><br />Read The Three-Body Problem if you love conceptual fiction or hard science fiction. Don't read this book if you're looking for lots of action, complex characters, or strong emotion. There's pretty slow pacing in the first half. It speeds up in the third quarter, and zips along at page-turning speed for the last 100 pages."]}
{"text": ["This book starts slow and then suddenly explodes with weirdness and suspense. I consider myself a moderate science-fiction fan, and find this a good level of technicality or &#34;hardness.&#34; The concepts are imaginative and fascinating. The story really makes you think about morality, civilization, enduring and responding to trauma/hardships, survival, and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). Also, if you don't usually read Chinese authors, it is eye-opening to see how that country's history and culture have shaped the content."]}
{"text": ["I read the three books in English non-stop, and each got better than the first.  That is truly rare.  I am now reading the Chinese version and re-reading the English version.  That says a lot when you read over 1,000 pages non-stop  It is a lot more than sci-fi, it is universal and broad.  I look forward to seeing the movie on a large screen.  The first book is a bit slow and confusing,  so just be patient as books 2 and 3 are worth the effort of reading book 1.  I would not have spent so much time on the video game chapters.  Just my opinion.  Enjoy."]}
{"text": ["I just reread this (because the third one in the trilogy had just come out, and now I could read the whole thing) and I was struck again by just how GOOD this book is.  If anything, I enjoyed it more the second time than I had the first.  One warning: this may be a better read for physics - y people, but in many ways it seems very different from &#34;traditional&#34; science fiction.  Am really looking forward to the other two."]}
{"text": ["I find it impossible to write about this remarkable series without spoilers, so spoilers ahoy!<br /><br />Man’s instinct for violence against ”others” — vividly detailed in early scenes set during the Chinese Cultural Revolution — triggers the events of this series, mirroring the bleak “axiom” proposed by a main character: to survive, intelligent life in the galaxy will be driven by imperative to commit genocide against other species. Far from being empty, the galaxy is teeming with advanced alien civilizations, all maintaining radio silence and ruthlessly exterminating any lifeform that betrays its location. Spy vs Spy on a galactic scale.<br /><br />The series is like Asimov’s Foundation, packed with epic events, thrills and magnificent hard-science concepts. But while just as deterministic as Hari Seldon’s “psychohistory,\" the “axiom” frames a grimmer universe. Whether or not you buy into the axiom, it marks a departure from most space operas, which present a universe of peril and hope. In Mr. Liu’s universe there is only peril. Ian M. Bank's Culture books are lighthearted romps compared to this trilogy.<br /><br />Something else Mr. Liu's series shares with Foundation is an occasionally flat and didactic storytelling style. Perhaps hard-science tales of this scope can’t avoid passages that read like a history textbook. Or perhaps the English translations, while skillful, can only go so far in adapting Chinese idiom for Western readers.<br /><br />Many of the characters are woefully two-dimensional (joke!). In Book 2 there's a embarrassing \"dream lover\" subplot in which a protagonist finds his ideal mate, a character so weirdly submissive and complacent I thought she would turn out to be an antagonist. But she ends up having little to do with the main story. In spite of this detour, the most vivid and compelling protagonists in the series are women.<br /><br />And for all its occasional issues with characterization and bland prose, the series just as often offers up nuggets of shining beauty and alternative narratives (a video game in the first book, children’s stories in the third). It zips back and forth from the prosaic and technical to the sublime and heart-rendingly tragic. The question “What if?” that animates all SF, crops up on almost every page. In particular, in the last part of the final book, weaponry that makes the Death Star look like a windup toy is responsible for some staggeringly beautiful and conceptually horrifying images of destruction.<br /><br />In terms of plotting, you can see the cataclysms coming a mile off (every time humanity gets complacent), but each time Mr. Liu shocks with audacious invention and a knack for putting an unexpected spin on your expectations.<br /><br />The series offers a contradictory message: humans are amoral, cruel, selfish, lazy, stupid apes; humans are redeemed by love, fortitude and unquenchable creativity. At the end, (big spoiler!) humanity is doomed by an act of love, a devastating reversal of standard tropes. Nonetheless, this catastrophe is presented as a redemption, of sorts."]}
{"text": ["The Three Body Problem  by Cixin Liu  Feb 7, 2017<br /><br />I learned about this book watching a TV interview with John Holdren, Barak Obama’s science advisrr.  (Who said, by the way, that Obama was the most science-savvy president since Thomas Jefferson).  Holdren said he and the president spent a good deal of time discussing ‘The Three Body Problem.’<br /><br />I don’t normally read science fiction but this is simply a terrific novel.  I found the first half a bit confusing and somewhat slow but shortly thereafter the book grabbed me by the throat.  The Three Body Problem meets my three criteria for a good (or very good) novel:  it’s well-written, it educates and it makes you think.<br /><br />I’ve read that Cixin Liu is the most popular science fiction writer in China and American readers are fortunate that the Chinese government allowed foreign publication – which I think is pretty rare.  I’m sure some of the elegance and subtlety of the original Chinese text was lost in the English translation but translator did a good job of making the prose clear.<br /><br />One might imagine the main point of Three Body Problem is a cautionary tale regarding purposeful communication with potential alien civilizations.  It is certainly faulty logic for a civilization with a tract record of genocide of every land it has invaded to think that a civilization with the ability for interstellar travel will be benign - how ultimately absurd.  But that cautionary tale is but one of many thought lessons provided by Cixin Liu.  Early portions of the book are set in the Chinese Cultural Revolution of the 1960s where reason and science were overthrown in the name of dogmatic purity (with one result being that millions of Chinese citizens starved to death).  One cannot but notice the comparisons of the Cultural Revolution to contemporary American politics.<br /><br />A marvelous read.  I look forward to the two other novels of the Three Body Trilogy.<br /><br />February 2017"]}
{"text": ["I knew nothing about this book when I picked it up, other than that a lot of people said it was great. And it was! It had been a while since I read a first-contact story, and I found this to be a really unique take. One thing that impressed me was how the author explained the physics in a way that was both interesting and easy to follow.<br /><br />Because the book is translated from Chinese, some of the phrasing and the author's voice might feel a little different—but in a really interesting way. It feels fresh. The book includes a note from Ken Liu about this, about the challenges of translation. I'd suggest reading that before the story. It made me enjoy it even more.

Haven't been so engrossed reading a book for a long time.<br /><br />Here is a piece of news today that I believe would feel like deja vu to fellow readers of the three-body problem:<br /><br />[TU Youyou] discovered one of the most effective treatments for<br />  malaria while working on a secret military project during China's<br />  Cultural Revolution<br /><br />  The 84-year-old pharmacologist was awarded half of the prestigious<br />  8m Swedish kronor prize for her discovery of artemisinin, a drug<br />  that proved to be an improvement on chloroquine, which had become<br />  far less effective as the malaria parasites developed resistance."]}
{"text": ["It's hard to describe this book without ruining the fun for future readers except to say, if you enjoy (and acknowledge) the fact that good science fiction begins with good science, then you will love this book.<br /><br />It calls into question so much of what we take &#34;for granted&#34; about our solar system's existence as well as asking the sorts of difficult questions that great literature should poke at. Who are we? How did we get here? Do we DESERVE to be here? And what if.... ?<br /><br />Well, IF you pass on this book, then you've missed out."]}
{"text": ["\"The Three Body Problem\", \"The Dark Forest\", \"Death's End\"<br /><br />An excellent series with an absolute minimum of scientific errors. Sure some of the science is in the \"maybe\" category but it comes from the top scientists working today.

If I'd read this book first, I'd not have purchased and read any of his other books."]}
{"text": ["I had a hard time finishing this book. I don’t blame the translator, nor the author. It’s probably very difficult translating from Chinese into English. I am fluent in Spanish and English, and every single book that I have read that was translated from one of those languages into the other definitely lost something in the translation.  I hesitated buying this book for a long time because of my experience reading translated works, but I had hoped this one might be different due to all of the great reviews and awards. But it wasn’t. Wish I could read Chinese because the basic premise was interesting and it would be great to have access to the fiction of China."]}
{"text": ["I was not prepared for how great a book this turned out to be. I was slightly prepared for the unusual style of the opening because I did read something about how Chinese science fiction operates by different rules. But it was far more of a departure than I had anticipated. I stuck with it and I really enjoyed the way the narrative shaped up in unexpected ways. This is a brilliant approach to hard science fiction with plenty of imaginative special effects within the scientific discourse. I am looking forward to the next piece of the story that will come out this summer. I didn't pay enough attention to the names, so I advise that readers take the time to fix onto the names of the characters, as it's easy to lose your way given that the names are Chinese and the unfamiliarity tends to blur who is doing what. Slow down and try not to miss anything."]}
{"text": ["I enjoyed the novel as science fiction, but my favorite part of reading it was its sections set during the cultural revolution.  It was a shock to me that a book coming out of the PRC could be so frank about the brutality, paranoia, and insanity of that dark chapter of Chinese history.  It doesn't read like a \"political novel\" in which the author clumsily puppets characters in a contrived plot for the purpose of exposing or condemning history.  Instead, the narrative built within that time period is deeply rooted in several characters who are compelling enough to make them the focus, even in the midst of the horrors they are enduring.  As the story moves forward, the contrast between that fanatical but impoverished past and the recognizably affluent and relatively liberal present is striking."]}
{"text": ["This is a science fiction masterpiece - hard SF in the great tradition. While reading, I was reminded of some of the greats, like Neal Stephenson's \"Snow Crash\", and Vernor Vinge's \"A Deepness in the Sky\". Besides the beautifully realized aliens and exotic technologies, it finds some of the darkest parts of human nature. And it manages to do this in a contemporary setting, not some wild future where rules don't matter. And as a bonus, we get flashback hard SF set in China's Cultural Revolution. I loved the heck out of this book, and can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy!"]}
{"text": ["This is hard sci-fi with a touch of the social upheaval that went through China due to the Cutural Revolution. That cultural war touched everyone, and every thing, in this book and it is fascinating to see how we define ourselves by the system we live in, even to the point of influencing how we approach science.  This is a book high in technical detail with vividly drawn, conflicted, characters. Most of the people in this book are damaged in some way and that damage plays a very critical part in their actions. This is not an easy read. Stick with it though, you'll be rewarded with a great story."]}
{"text": ["I am the pickiest of science fiction readers. The only fictions I get excited about are by Neal Stephenson, David Brin, Daniel Saurez and Robert J. Sawyer. Most others disappoint, they make me dumber...not smarter.<br /><br />Three-Body Problem and author Cixin Liu is now on my most recommended list. I have nothing but the highest praise for this author.<br /><br />Three-Body Problem is a reading experience much like David Brin's Existence and Neal Stephenson's Seveneves - a turn of human affairs greater in significance than any previous experience for the species. All three books deliver on their lofty mission.<br /><br />As an American, usually reading American-centric plots and characters, it has been a real pleasure to experience a plot with China at the center of its cultural Universe. I'm continuing to read more of Cixin Liu's books partially because of the desire to place China in a more dominant position in my mental framework. The other reason is he is of the most elite in the world when it comes to writing the hardest of science fiction."]}
{"text": ["The book starts with an interesting opening but fairly quickly became fairly mundane and boring. The characters aren't very exciting, but they're definitely very fleshed out and well written, I just didn't care at all about what they were doing or their personality. All the technical physics jargon and mathematical problems posed by the 3 body problem seemed interesting, but then I remembered I don't like math and having uninteresting characters try to figure out complicated math problems in literate form was just boring.<br /><br />I kept reading and expecting something exciting to happen...and it just doesn't. There's a lot better sci-fi out there."]}
{"text": ["While I enjoyed the sweeps and surprises of the story, in the end I found the English translation to be less than satisfactory in execution. Many times the story was choppy, short sentenced and stilted, at others it flowed much better with some hint at what I think is the originals style."]}
{"text": ["There are a number of things that set this trilogy apart from others. It is written from a Chinese perspective, and only recently translated. The point of view is very Chinese, different from other SciFi I have read, a fascinatingly alternative  point of view. But what really grabbed me about this trilogy is the very, very different view of the Universe and the other intelligent species out there. This is not a friendly universe. The physics is interesting and convincing, the incredibly creative concepts about how different intelligent cultures might interact is fascinating and terrifying.  A must read."]}
{"text": ["As every other reviewer says, it's best to go into this without too many expectations.  For me, it was a bit like &#34;Ender's Game&#34; meets &#34;Foundation&#34; with lots of Chinese culture/history and science along the way.  (In fact, much more science than the average sci-fi novel I've read.)<br /><br />My only complaint is the book is so dense with plot that it comes at the expense of character development and narrative.  There is a LOT of expository dialogue and perhaps because of this the characters are somewhat 2D - memorable yes, but a bit cliche as well.  In spite of that, the novel succeeds very much on the scale of its world-building ambitions and I would highly recommend it to anyone with the patience to dive deep, deep, deep into a thoughtfully conceived (and meticulously translated!) book."]}
{"text": ["I didn't have a lot of expectation on a translated book because I've noticed in the past that there could be a lot of subtlety lost in the translation.  If this is the case for &#34;The Three Body Problem&#34; then I'd be fascinated to read the original Chinese version to get even more from it.  The overall story is of the first contact trope but is presented in a new and interesting way.  I found the overall story engaging and interesting while being able to overlook some of the more obvious items (for those who are familiar with math the title basically gives away a large portion of the story, but that's OK).  Overall a good book, worth a read.  I am now on to the second book in the series and have high hopes for it."]}
{"text": ["I am relatively sure that the Remembrance of the Earth's Past trilogy will be remembered in the future as one of science fiction's classics and a must read. It is hard to say more in this review without spoiling people but I was seriously in awe of the Trilogy up until the last page, especially the way the author introduces concepts that that have, to my knowledge, not existed before in science fiction. It is for this reason that I think it will go down in science fiction to be as famous as Asimov's 3 Laws. I also love that this series is for a change, not centered on Europe or America but China and I personally learned a lot I didnt know about Chinese history."]}
{"text": ["This was a book that kept sneaking up on me in different ways.  The writing (translation) was what got me started and carried me through some parts where I wasn't quite sure where it all was going.  Like the best science fiction, it had characters and themes that were not only believable but very recognizable in our experience today.  The gradual reveal of the final direction was fascinating as was the human traits that drove each action.  It took me a while to digest the ending, but after a week I think it was just as it should be in that it kept me thinking almost obsessively about what it really meant."]}
{"text": ["I picked this up because of combination of what I heard on NPR and what I heard from Adam Savage (via YouTube). I liked that it was from a non-western perspective but also because it addressed a different aspect of alien contact. Be warned this is not an easy read. There is no jargon and the translation reads smoothly, but the concepts are profound (at least to me) and the science is not \"fantastic\" (for the most part)."]}
{"text": ["This is a fascinating sci-fi tale by Chinese author Cixin Liu.  It begins very mysteriously, and quickly crescendos into suspense, international intrigue, and fantastic plot twists.  Won't describe too much of the plot, since the main twist is what sets up the rest of the trilogy.  I'm currently reading the last entry in the trilogy, and am excited to see how it all ends.<br /><br />The best part about 3BP, and its sequels, is that it's a 'hard' science sci-fi tale.  While there are still fantastic leaps of technology, they are always grounded in reality and physics.  Cixin won't simply say, &#34;They had a laser gun, and they shooted it.&#34;  He'll describe the power source, how it was built, and the energy output.  This is Arthur C. Clarke storytelling for the modern era.<br /><br />I have to admit that I'm not widely read on non-English authors, and among even those, it would be mainly Europeans.  I found this translation to be easy to read, with helpful footnotes along the way for more obscure references to non-Eastern readers.  While difficult to describe precisely, I could always sort of tell that I was reading something not written in native English.  However, I kept an open mind about the prose, and enjoyed a thoroughly good story."]}
{"text": ["You may think if/when the day comes that we learn of other beings in the universe, that it will be a great day...I promise you that this book may well cause you to rethink that...as well as your position on many other things in life.<br /><br />This book is written from the perspective of every day Chinese people...and their views on life....and their experiences and if you can allow yourself not to get too hung up on the names, you are going to be taken to places and sciences and thoughts that will challenge you, entertain you and maybe even frighten you a little bit.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!  Now its on to Book 2 in the three book series."]}
{"text": ["A friend recommended this book to me and I was excited, so I bought a Chinese version for myself and an English for my husband. Neither of us could finish it. My impression for the first 20 pages or so: elementary school kids writing style, but has a few interesting ideas. So I kept reading it. As soon as I got to the video game parts, I just had to skip pages( really? You wanna explain to me how someone plays a video game in like 10-20 pages)? Eventually I gave up. I have never read a book in my entire life that is so poorly written and poorly structured. There are no characters and no common sense. It does however have excessive flat dialogues! Wow.  The Chinese cultural revolution background is just so awkward and I don’t see the point (maybe It serves a function later on in the book but I just could not keep reading it).<br />To whoever bought the English version and thinks the awfulness might be due to translation: the original version is equally bad, maybe even worse."]}
{"text": ["Words are not possible to describe the power of this book. And the same goes for the larger trilogy of which it is the first volume. Reading this trilogy has reminded me that there are literary treasures in the non-English speaking world that we ignore at our peril. I do not usually read in the sci-fi genre, but I made an exception for this book and I'm glad I did. In some ways, Liu's imaginative writing transcends any one genre. This is storytelling at its best. On every level, this novel is deep, rich, imaginative, and beautifully written--breathtakingly good."]}
{"text": ["Ya' know . . . I'd still recommend any sci-fi fan read this book, despite its problems.  It really offers a totally different take on the ol' &#34;alien invasion&#34; trope.  Along the way it presents some stunningly original ideas and imagery, stuff that really bowled me over.  The problems are largely literary.  I know translation is a pain, and I know Ken Liu is a successful writer in his own right (in English), but there were places where the translation was too literal.  Lots of weird choppy sentences, some very odd turns of phrases, etc.  (This is beyond what I might consider Chinese colloquialisms, which I think are actually handled well.)  The biggest problem, however, is the shallow characterization.  Da Shi is the only character who deserves that title.  Everybody else (well, maybe not Ye Wenjie) is just a tool for advancing the plot.  Dialog is largely wooden.  The science suffers from over-exposition; the people, under-exposition.  But it's still an intriguing read because of its conceptual originality.  In the right hands this material could become a much better movie (or mini-series) than it is a novel.  It remains to be seen if the one that has already been filmed is up to the task."]}
{"text": ["Very original plot premise, carried out to it's logical (but rather difficult) conclusion by the end of the trilogy, Death's End. I am a physician, and not particularly technical. I didn't encounter any suspension-of-disbelief-destroying science or astronomy errors in this volume. Other, more technical types, may find some. Some of the plot twists in the second volume do seem to overlook some basics of orbital mechanics, but this didn't kill my enjoyment. Three-Body Problem struck me as deeply original, and the few developed characters were far better sketched than what one usually encounters in hard sci-fi novels."]}
{"text": ["It's a very gripping and unique story. It's kind of dark, in a weird Chinese sort of way. I'm amazed that the author was able to create such a *scientific* plot, without it coming off as dry, or unbelievable. It's the opposite, thoroughly intriguing from beginning to end.<br /><br />Edit: I've finished the whole series, and WOW. It's one of the most interesting and unique sci-fi's I've ever read. The series has a poetic fairy tale kind of feel, except longer and full of interesting technical details. The characters are incredible, and the plot events equally so. The only thing that stops this from being my favorite series of all time, is that like I said earlier it's a bit dark."]}
{"text": ["I found this story absolutely fascinating and can't wait to start the next book in the trilogy. The story based in China and written by a Chinese author/scientist provides a whole new take on sci-fi for those used to western writers. The use of foundational physics and astronomy to demonstrate the likely impossible task of solving the three body problem is especially interesting told using an extraterrestrial storyline. So fortunate this story was translated into English!"]}
{"text": ["A wonderful work of science fiction, fusing constantly inventive scientific imagination with strong writing. For readers outside China the exotic Chinese setting reinforces both the strangeness of the alternative reality, and the universal messages of the book. This is both a gripping story and a meditation on humanity's future."]}
{"text": ["This is an interesting and unusual read. The sci-fi part of the book is good – well thought-through, some new and interesting ideas, and few (but some) theoretical flaws.<br />The form is unusual. I don't know if this is an effect of Chinese writing style, the style of this author, or just something for this particular book, but the way the story is told is sometimes very different from how European and US sci-fi is told. Several parts of the book made me think of adventure games on computers back in the nineties – a hero goes to a place, has a scripted interaction with someone and picks up clues, and then moves on to another place without the chance of asking any more questions. It's an interesting and sometimes refreshing style, and as long as you're open for new formats you'll probably have a good read.<br /><br />Note that this is the first part of a trilogy, and I haven't read all parts yet."]}
{"text": ["It takes forever to develop... The characters communicate with each other in strange ways...Probably an issue of translating from Chinese..."]}
{"text": ["I will admit, when I first started reading this book, I couldn't understand why it had gotten such high praise. Yet I ended up reading the whole trilogy. I don't know if it's the translation or the style of writing, but I initially found the writing quite jarring. But once I got into it, I couldn't stop reading. I've gone so far as to tell people that even if you don't love this one, I'd still recommend books 2 and 3. I personally thought they were better."]}
{"text": ["This is a story filled with so much science that I found myself googling theories and problems to truly understand them, and to know if they were actual facts - what is the three-body problem? how many dimensions are there? what is a syzygy? what dimension does a proton exists in?<br /><br />It starts off with Ye Wenjie witnessing the death of her father during the Chinese Cultural Revolution. This gets events in motion, where Ye goes on to work in a military base secret project. Things jump ahead years in the future to nanoscientist Wang Miao experiencing impossible science phenomena like numbers appearing out of nowhere and a &#34;blinking universe.&#34; Much of the story also takes place in an online game called Three-Body, and even on a distant planet.<br /><br />At times the science gets heavy, and I'm thankful for certain characters that can slow things down. Other times it can feel like information is being dumped when you really just want to know what happens after that.<br /><br />But overall, this is a read that I will surely be thinking about for a long time."]}
{"text": ["An insight into the \"human\" condition of perpetual struggle and desperation that all life must face. That which drives us into contact with other extraterrestrial life is not the desire for exploration and adventure but rather the need to find an escape, a refuge, an Eden defined solely by it's sense of security and freedom from the fears of daily existence, including the violence and repressions of our societies. The genius of this author is that he turns this tired paradigm --that of the lucky survivors fleeing a dying, used up, and corrupt earth--on it's head. They're coming to replace us not due to any need for conquest or due to the moral failure of their own society but because of the harshness of their home planet and the twisted moralities that grow out of a desperate need to escape a celestial and inescapable doom. Add in the paranoid backdrop of China's cultural revolution, the hubris of Western culture, protagonists who have experienced and committed terrible crimes, and the near mysticism of advanced physics and you have a recipe for one deep read. One that goes beyond the normal escapism of the genre, leaving you inspired, depressed, enervated, and ultimately looking for some time to sort our place in the cosmos, \"bugs\" though we are."]}
{"text": ["I recommend Cixin Liu's Three Body Problem if you enjoyed Haruki Murakami's 1Q84, Sergei Lukyanenk's Night Watch. I seek out non-western science fiction and fantasy as I find the differing cultural viewpoint leads to an extra edge of creativity and fantastical extrapolation. Three Body Problem does not disappoint in this application. Yes, the narrative structure is different than most american novel arcs (as translator Ken Liu mentions in his excellent afterward), but that is part of the fun. The slow burn at the start gives way to some amazingly imaginative scenes toward the end (the practical application of 'the flying blade(!!!)'). Also enjoyed that one of the main protagonists is a scientist who happens to be female. If you've read this far, I suggest you pick it up!"]}
{"text": ["I didn’t find this book to be one that I wanted to continue to read, it was with great effort I managed to finish it, and I’m not satisfied, unfortunately. I have to say it’s just not my cup of tea. The characters seemed to meld into one another and talked with the same voice, and the story had no discernible plot, nor did I find any character’s motivation compelling. I wanted to like this but it was a real slog. I won’t be reading the others."]}
{"text": ["Not for the lazy reader the Three-Body problems is highly engaging and requires you think about the physics that make the story both real and fascinating.  This book occupied my mind even when I was not reading it. Highly recommended."]}
{"text": ["This is a novel originally written in Mandarin, and so credit for the English version must be shared between the author and translator. What results from their combined efforts is a very unique and fascinating work of sci-fi. I had wondered what sci-fi from a non-western cultural perspective might look like, and here's one answer from Chinese author Liu Ci Xin: a story that stretches from roots in the cultural revolution out to the stars and whoever might be contacting humanity from them. The plot unfolds mysteriously and will keep you guessing, then surprise you with twists that turn in the opposite direction you might have come to expect from typical sci-fi. Definitely a fascinating and original book and important contribution to sci-fi from Liu, it held my interest by confounding my expectations, introducing interesting characters who don't fall neatly into the standard tropes, providing a really creative take on what a different alien culture might be like, and positing how differently &#34;those in the know&#34; would react to the knowledge and communication of advanced life in the universe before any actual visits can take place."]}
{"text": ["Brilliant science fiction concepts largely derived from physics.  I did not identify with one of the main characters, Ye Wenjie, at all, since she seems like a sadistic, depressed, and passive-aggressive nut. Wang Miao was much more likeable but he doesn't really play a big part in this story, just leads us through a fantasy land symbolized by a civilization-based game with levels.  Loved Shi Qiang though.  Can't believe there would be so many people willing to sell out to an alien race 450 years on, even with our imperfections from assuming we're Earth's only valid species."]}
{"text": ["Im only halfway through the first book (The Three Body Problem) and I am purchasing the whole trilogy. Its excellent, well worth any invested reading if youre into scifi or even theoretical infotainment like Michio Kaku and Neil deGrasse Tyson. Its a true page turner, and I spent about 90 minutes hours a day ploughing through it, and always upset when Im out of time to read it for the day!"]}
{"text": ["Beautiful prose and memorable imagery. An emotional story with a novel plot. Key plot points built around physics problems the author has spent a lot of time thinking about, and who helps you to see those problems through his passionate eyes. A translator who has worked hard to make a story rooted in a foreign culture approachable for American readers. Wry, understated jokes.<br /><br />Altogether, by far the best sci-fi book I've read in a long time."]}
{"text": ["I truly enjoyed the book and the thoughts it created both in terms of quantum physics and philosophy of ethics. The story has a slow and intricate pace you might find in a strong anime storyline which can be hard to push through at times but the strong ending makes it all worth it."]}
{"text": ["The Three Body Problem Novel Review<br /><br />The Three Body Problem, written by  Liu Cixin and translated by Ken Liu, is an astounding book.  As one of the few Chinese novels translated into English, and the only one with a team of this caliber (bestselling author, award winning translator, mainstream publisher), it was a book that I waited for with massive anticipation as soon as I heard about it.<br /><br />The novel is the first of a bestselling Chinese SF trilogy, written by the &#34;George R.R. Martin of China&#34;.  It brings what is familiar to Chinese culture and history into new and strange events, making it all the more interesting for English readers.  The cultural references are brilliantly handled by the translator--I was never lost or confused--and the footnotes were each and everyone critical to the story when inserted; you could see how intentional the translator was about placing them, and it gave me faith of the deliberation he put into every sentence.<br /><br />I appreciated so much how the mindsets of the characters were clearly expressed; they were strange yet logical in their own ways.  I often find that translators lose the unique individual's voice in the translation, in large part due to the foreignness of the text itself, but also due to the natural inclination of the translator's own voice taking over.  This was not the case in this novel.  Each character was unique and equally brilliant.  The craft of their design impressed me constantly.<br /><br />As for the story itself, without giving too much away...<br /><br />Science has impossibly and suddenly stopped progress, prestigious evidence-based scientists are committing suicide as the laws of nature break, and a powerful organization seemingly bent on both saving the human race and destroying it at the same time might or might not be responsible.<br /><br />Yeah.  It's a lot.<br /><br /> I was entirely convinced of the backgrounds of the characters (whoa smart lingo made readable) and I was baffled constantly to how everything might come together. Thankfully, as the pace of the novel unraveled the most pressing questions at the most critical moments of WTFisgoingon, I was drawn along the line of frustration and intrigue.  I definitely noticed many built-in casually handled things as a western reader: a depth in brevity, an openness to understanding the people behind certain political and authoritative corruptness, the simultaneous value and low value of the individual, and always the strong limits to ones ability to act--and how to act anyway.<br />Dichotomy, I'd summarize, is the highest art of the writing.<br /><br />The elegantly executed &#34;conclusion&#34; (first of a trilogy, after all), made me feel in reflection, that the story was too unbelievable to work, and yet when reading I was absolutely convinced it was real.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, not only for the entertainment and mystery and cultural exploration, but for the introspection that you will doubtlessly confront while reading it.  Fantastically done.  5 stars."]}
{"text": ["The word that best describes this book is tedious.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  The details regarding the “science” become repetitive, confusing, and frankly boring.  Near the end some story lines are explained, but then the author goes off again this time about the Trisolarins’ effort to project a multi dimensional pair of protons at Earth.  Gawd, I just wanted the book to end.<br /><br />Interesting concept to project something to Earth that will stall our own technological development so that we’re not more advanced than they are by the time they arrive at our planet, but horribly written."]}
{"text": ["Fascinating science fiction.  All the complexity of John C. Wright, yet with sentimentality evocative of Ursula LeGuin.<br />Believable characters who are transitioning through life and history validate the story and the outlandish elements.i look forward I reading more!"]}

Believe it or not, this book, as good as it is, is in my opinion, the least of the 3 books.  But what really struck me is the consistency of flow thruout the e novels.  The author's central vision stats true from the first pagd of this book to the final chapter of the last book in the trilogy.  This is certainly not a fairy tale, but a clear and dispassionate vision of the universe and our humble place in the scheme of things.  Please go read, and be awed as I still am."]}
{"text": ["This is the best of the three books in the trilogy, although that may be a function of the translation rather than the underlying story (apparently the translator for this book is different from that of the others).  Chinese Science Fiction is odd to American readers and odd, in this case, is good.  Hard science intermingled with solid political theory and history mixed with human stories not limited to just boy-meets-girl.  It's an engaging and worthy read."]}
{"text": ["Of course, this is one of the greatest SiFi books ever. The book (and its sequels) have been awarded every possible award, prize, and tribute. Of course, all of these awards, prizes, and tributes are entirely deserved. It is well worth noting that the translation to English appears to be excellent. Since I am not fluent in Chinese, this is really just a guess on my part. However, the English version is excellent in its own right, implying a superb translation.<br /><br />A fascinating political note is the extremely negative portrayal of the Cultural Revolution in China. I have never read such a searing, hostile depiction of the madness of China in the 1960s. Frankly, I was not aware that such writing was possible in China. Conversely, the name &#34;Mao&#34; is notable by its absence from the book. Mao does appear, but only very infrequently and in a relatively neutral context. Apparently, some politically sensitive topics still exist in China.<br /><br />However, the bottom line is not political. This is one of the great SiFi novels of the last 100 years (or ever)"]}
{"text": ["Simply because the author is Chinese, this sci fi tale already has a distinct tone.<br /><br />But he does so much more that's interesting, both in evolving or current science and blending history.<br /><br />I wish we could have spent more time with certain charters - the novel is broad and as a result not as deep of a charter study as I'd like."]}
{"text": ["This book is very well written, building depth in the characters and detail in the story line from beginning to end; filled with supremely fascinating ideas. The fact that the author is Chinese provides a very different perspective from much of the science fiction I have read, and I think this is part of the book’s appeal."]}
{"text": ["I could not put this book down. I just finished reading the Old Man's War saga, and stumbled on this trilogy. All the SF I had read up until then was American centered, so this book was a very refreshing change. The perspective is enlightening, and the language and images are perfectly crafted. Beautiful book, with a fast paced, mystery ridden plot that keeps you awake long hours at night. TOTALLY recommended."]}

Never in the world did I think that a Chinese writer would be able to leave me feeling so satiated...while still hungry for more.<br /><br />The hard science of trying to imagine living in an unfathomable 3 star solar system, and then taking me by the hand into the quantum eleven dimension world of a particle. This is not for the lazy TV drama fantasy reader.<br /><br />Then for the first time to fully look at the Cultural Revolution through Chinese eyes as those eyes are turned towards the sky...to share that worldview. The translator deserves the highest awards because he has brought us closer to our Chinese Brothers."]}
{"text": ["I am a scifi junkie... and have read hundreds of scifi novels.  This book manages to be fresh. I loved it. I have now read all 3 in this series and wish  there were more...<br /><br />The very ending of the third book isn't what i would have written if it was my decision....but... all told... the 3 books form an amazing story. I saw some reviewers saying they couldn't suspend disbelief, couldn't understand the concepts, couldn't get thru the clunky translation, etc...  Personally, i never felt any of those things.  Phenomenal books."]}
{"text": ["This is a review for the entire trilogy. This is hard sci-fi involving quantum physics, higher dimensions, and unique ideas. Unfolding protons from 11 dimensions down to two? Sounds plausible. Well thought out, self consistent plot from begining to end. This is an author I'm going to be paying attention to. Kudos to the translators, too. When I read the descriptions, the similies, the metaphores, I think this must be exactly what the author intended."]}
{"text": ["The book was a bit hard to get into at first. I think that was because the writing logic in the Chinese language is just different in English and the Chinese-to-English translator/writer admitted to such. However, after a while I got into it just fine and was amazed at the imaginative description of the multiple dimensions at the quantum level that the original author creatively presented."]}
{"text": ["Liu Cixin's \"The Three-Body Problem\" starts out as a series of disjointed narratives that gradually come together to form a very interesting and worthwhile story. While some might find the non-linear structure to be rather off-putting, I felt that it was necessary in order to provide the reader with the grand scope the author so obviously wishes to carve out. Such a grandiose narrative is necessary when you have a saga where important details emerge during the time of the Cultural Revolution, gradually setting us up for a fairly pessimistic tale regarding an alien invasion and the future of our species. My main point of critique would be that for much of the time, the novel sacrifices character and plot development for scientific and technical explanations - but then again, such complexities are commonplace and expected within the realm of \"hard\" science fiction."]}
{"text": ["Good sci-fi from a Chinese author: one can't help but feel that good literature connects cultures!<br />The story is a multi-layered variation on the alien invasion theme. As a longstanding sci-fi fan, I appreciated the complexities of the plot and the plausibility of the alternate world created by the author. But sometimes the narrative seems to slow down, perhaps because the complexity of the scientific solutions proposed requires lenghty explanations (which penalize the rythm)...<br />All in all a very interesting read: will I pick up the second volume of the trilogy? I sure would like to know how it ends..."]}
{"text": ["Starts off a bit slow, but definitely gets going. The rest of the series gets better and better. Death's End == mind blown. A tremendous conclusion to the series.  Still thinking about the book, and it's been a couple of months already since I finished reading it.  If you are a sci-fi fan, you would have  known and had read this book already, that's how good it is, so go read it!"]}
{"text": ["My favorite scifi book in a long time. It's more concept driven than story driven so if you like stories about people see in a sci-fi setting, maybe it's not for you. This is a story about scifi with people as a backdrop"]}
{"text": ["This book is great and I don't want to say much more than that and risk ruining anything.  If you like science-fiction with a humanist bend, you'll dig this series.  This is the first sci-fi book that I've read by a Chinese author, and an added bonus has been learning a bit more about the history and some of the settings the story takes place in, and just have a story told from a different perspective than the one I'm used to.  I'm already almost done with the second book and can't wait for to read the next one."]}
{"text": ["Lots of very interesting ideas explored, woven from a sci-fi master. One thing to take into consideration is that it is a translated work. This means that the translation will depend upon the translator, not necessarily reflecting the true words/intentions of the author. Overall though the ideas and imagination are worth the read. I won't go into any details of the story but I will say that the story revolves around humanity (both its ugly and beautiful sides)."]}
{"text": ["Absolute drivel! I’m an avid sci-fi reader and this book, although hailed as wonderful, falls flat, without any substance to the underlying theories. It is pedantic and pretentious. The characters are one-dimensional and juvenile. In particular, the author’s description of the ideal woman is nauseating (docile and mildly educated, but not so educated as to be too independent thinking). Do yourself a favor and skip this immature attempt at sci-fi."]}
{"text": ["This is a science heavy sci fi book. There is a lot more science than the fantasy aspect. It is something that you could imagine happening in a similar society as the near future. The philosophical questions are good and the science and ideology around it is thought provoking. It does have a couple problems i think but i cant talk too much about them without giving away spoilers. Overall a good read and def worth the kindle price"]}
{"text": ["As an astrodynamicist, I vouch that the explanations of the three body problem are on the mark.  Other elements of quantum mechanics and multidimensional geometry, not as much.  There is so much scientific and technical content that those without deep technical background will miss many of the most intriguing portions of the novel."]}
{"text": ["First, I must say, this is a great translation. Ken Liu does a great job of maintaining the integrity of this novel while changing the language. Even while reading it you feel as though you are reading something foreign, which in this case is a very good thing. I am a little upset that Ken Liu isn't translating the next two in the series, but I am sure that Joel Martinsen, given his credentials, will do a great job as well.<br /><br />&#34;The Three-Body Problem&#34; by Cixin Liu is a fantastic start to what I hope is a great science fiction saga. It does not try to fool you into thinking it is a complete novel, as it clearly states it is the first of a trilogy. It also spends it's time setting up the story so that you really get to know the characters and problems that the world is having. Very few 'questions' go unanswered, which helps gives the reader some feelings of accomplishment when finishing it, but the overall story is just beginning and Liu leaves us wanting to see what happens next.<br /><br />The major characters in this story are really well developed. They all have human qualities that make them easy to relate to while also making it hard for the reader to decide who exactly is in the wrong. One of the best things about this novel is that it doesn't just have technology as it's scientific element, but that it also delves into social science, which is something I think is overlooked in this generation of authors. A lot of questions about humanity and it's overall value come up. Liu maintains his Chinese roots, giving the reader a valuable insight into another culture. I hope this is something Liu continues to do in the following books.<br /><br />The reason I gave this novel 4 stars and not 5 is because it sometimes gets bogged down with scientific jargon that has no relevancy to the story. It has a lot of really cool ideas and concepts, but it could have explained them in a much simpler manner. Overall this is a great novel that well deserves it's current Hugo nomination. I hope to see more science fiction coming out of China over the years and I really hope readers catch on to the types of thing authors like Cixin Liu are trying to do."]}
{"text": ["IMHO, not good sci fi... very hard to follow as storyline jumps around<br /> Way too much detail on issues not related to sci fi. Because orginal was written in Chinese,  the translation is a bit \"offkey\" at times"]}
{"text": ["This book is excellent. It was wonderful reading a science fiction novel from a different culture. I enjoyed how the story was multi-generational and unpredictable. The characters were interesting and multi-dimensional. I would recommend this to anyone who loves sci-fi with lots of scientific knowledge. There wasn't any gapping holes and overall it was an incredibly enjoyable read. The ending left me feeling different from other sci-fi books I have read; hopeful and sad. So good! I can't wait to have my whole family read it so we can talk about it."]}
{"text": ["This book is dense but beautiful. I love the story at its heart for it stirred my emotions. Through the course of this story I was fascinated, frightened, awed, angered, inspired and now worried all over again. The story of Ye Wenjie, Wang and the Trisolarans, a decades-long revenge tale and warning that actions have consequences is a brilliant one. I will read book 2, but perhaps a little slower. If I have one fault it is with me and my lack of scientific knowledge."]}
{"text": ["I'm really not a fan of science fiction, but I had a curiosity about the three body problem and an affinity for things Chinese.  To me, science fiction must be somewhat believable.  This novel was not.  For instance, where did the \"countdown\" messages come from, and how did they manage to come in the form of such human inventions as hours and Morse Code?  And that a singe proton can be converted into a mega computer by flipping a couple dimensions... too far out for me.<br />On the plus side - the English translation by Ken Liu is excellent.  I did enjoy reading the book because of his language, even though I couldn't stomach the plot."]}
{"text": ["Imagination that makes sense scientifically. Much like how the 3body game was hiding a sense of deep reality through a simplistic design, the concepts and content of this book, albeit imaginary, can hold true in some deeper sense. This is a wonderful book for those who can enjoy science and imagination together with an open mind. Perhaps this book is the embodiment of the phrase , \" Reality is stranger than fiction\" in its own world. It's a portal to another dimension. I read a couple of reviews from people who couldn't get through the book and am wondering why they even bothered to advertise their lack of understanding or limited reading potential. Do not be side-tracked by those. This book genuinely deserves your reading time."]}
{"text": ["This is my first exposure to Cixin Liu's work and it has made me an avid fan ready for more! This work of science fiction focuses on expanding what we really know of science and extrapolating into the future. Unlike most books about aliens, there is. no epic war of the world; rather the author builds a mysterious and ominous situation in which the reader, like the characters of the book, must figure out what is happening. To the author's merit, not only is it a great and entertaining work of science fiction, but it touches in many important issues of our times, like climate change and the true purpose of our existence, in a universe where we may or may not be alone. Even if you are not a science fiction fan, this work is beautifully crafted and makes a great read for all types."]}
{"text": ["A very interesting SyFy read which doesn’t suffer from being a translated work. If you’re a Science Fiction reader, this is a book that should be on your ‘must read’ list."]}
{"text": ["Liked - the author's knowledge of physics and the translator's ability to translate to language understandable by the 'nonphysics' readers. Also liked the point of view - world/universe wide. Found it intriguing to find an 'old world' reference to quantum physics mixed with the author's imagination of where this would lead. Much to like about this series."]}
{"text": ["This story instantly become one of my favorite science fiction novels. It draws you in as all great books do with a great science fiction mystery. The author gives you enough hints to guess what is going on but by the end you see the true genius of his writing and his incredible imagination. The core idea I saw throughout was whether scientific advancement goes hand in hand with moral advancement. I also saw the evil in believing humanity is so far lost that we don't deserve to write our own history. This story truly awakened a realization in how bizarre it is we yearn to know of other life in the universe but don't cherish the life surrounding us everyday."]}
{"text": ["The scale of world creation in this novel is inspiring and thought provoking. You'll learn about physics, culture, and human nature.<br /><br />Second, reading a Chinese work in English on this topic is doubly interesting: how much do we really understand each other and think similar thoughts here on Earth? Do we have any hope of communicating accurately with Others?"]}
{"text": ["Three body is a wildly original premise. It’s rich world(s) draw the reader in to explore the mysteries that are slowly revealed. I can’t help but feel that some of the soul is missing in the translation, and the prose suffers at times. Some of the fanciful science takes leaps that are hard to follow, hurting the believability of the premise. Some of the characters feel thin compared to the richness of the plot. However, the book moves with an enjoyable pace that kept me interested."]}
{"text": ["Not sure if this is a low bid translation but I dound it unreadable."]}
{"text": ["Enjoyed the first 2/3 of the book more than the last 1/3 before the answers were revealed. I understand this is science fiction...but have always felt that the hallmark of good science fiction is to write a world that feels believable and this book just falls short at key parts."]}
{"text": ["At times poetic and brilliantly paced, offering allusions to Chinese society and history, often in fashions that reflect elements of universal human nature. The points touching on advanced science and physics bear a ring of substance but are at times fictionalized. A satisfying conclusion leaving a reader in anticipation for the next work in the series."]}
{"text": ["This work brings both exciting new science fiction concepts and a distinctly different cultural context. It presents a plausible future extended from the historical recent past of China. It is so incommensurable with western science fiction that a review like this one cannot prepare a reader for the experience of it."]}
{"text": ["This first in a trilogy stands with the greats of science fiction.  Scientifically engaging, literary juxtapositions, social backgounds to give nuance, and characters that don't overdo it.  There aren't really any  heros in this book, but there certainly are characters.  The science is not easy,  yet it is approachable.  It was a quick yet very engaging read, never boring.  If your a fan of late 20th and early 21st century science fiction writers, you'll love this.  Read on MacDuff."]}
{"text": ["Very challenging book, but well worth the effort. It's dense and plodding at times, with many intricate and confusing plot lines to try to follow, but every time the author pulls the threads together he leaves you stunned and awestruck. I won't try to explain any of the plot because I don't want to deprive anyone of the whiplash mind bending effects of reading this book, but I will say that it is one of the best science fiction novels I've read in years."]}
{"text": ["One of the best science fiction books I have read in the last year. If you like thinking about the mysteries of physics then you will probably like this book. I was interested in the story through every chapter. Unlike some books where you have to read 100 pages before the story gets going this was on the move from the first few pages. Makes you think about how stupid human beings must be to have sent anything out into space including radio signals for ET to discover."]}
{"text": ["Great new book in the &#34;searching for first contact&#34; genre of science fiction. Translation was very smooth, with good translator's notes in footnotes and a helpful list of characters at the beginning. My only criticism is that there is an awful lot of &#34;wind up&#34; in this book for the payoff pitch. I have not read the other books in the series yet (will do so) but suspect that it might work better as part of the whole rather than a stand alone book."]}
{"text": ["I put this down to cultural nuance, but the translation is wooden.  Some very clever ideas but the writing is dull and detracts from the concepts.  I found none of the characters convincing."]}
{"text": ["It's not clear how much of the literary value of this work is damaged by bad translation, and how much of the damage comes from the author's writing skills. Will probably appeal to those who like to argue for hours over the \"plausibility\" of the tech in Star Wars and/or Star Trek. This one didn't leave me with a desire to read the remainder of the trilogy."]}
{"text": ["An interesting and strange book that I enjoyed most of the time. Very similar to Foundation in style in that it felt like one man’s simulation of the future filled in with short stories and though experiments. Very similar to Foundation in pacing in that it lacking it.<br /><br />I recommend it if for no other reason than it’s so alien when compared to American sci-fi. Just be ready for some other culture’s repetitive “humans are flawed” oversimplification to be beat into your head again and again."]}
{"text": ["This book hits all the points that make scifi great: interesting and informative history, fantastic science and speculation, and most importantly examination of the human condition, including what makes people do good or evil and how people, how people are manipulated, and how to act in uncertainty. An excellent and compelling read."]}
{"text": ["Like a Chinese Neal Stephenson, Cixin Liu crafts a tale that spans decades and that goes off into deep tangents that wall readers through the (what I assume to be) real science behind the fictional concepts. The description of the game in the book is as addictive as playing a video game in real life in that you can’t wait to see how each new puzzle is solved.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the story itself, as long as it is, seems more like a prelude to the actual story which I’m assuming starts in the next book. The good news is that this book was compelling enough to definitely pick up that next one."]}
{"text": ["It was exciting to read a translation of sci fi from Chinese to English.... the format and emphases of the story seemed different than most American Sci fi, so the plot seemed slower to unfold and the characters more opaque to me.. mostly bc it’s just a different way of telling a story. But ultimately, it seems to be most about creating a new world and uncovering the science behind that world. An enjoyable read... still wondering if I should read the other 2 though."]}
{"text": ["It starts off well. Peters out as bit towards the end with a clear intention of following up with sequels. Though it sounds like the translation was well done and thorough I suspect something was still lost in bringing it to English."]}
{"text": ["Ironically the book embraced  exactly the concept of what I want to see in a SF book vs the Western &#34;shoot it up, but with lasers&#34; type, but it went way too far over the other side and it was actually impossible (for me at least) to stay up with the plot.. Beware of what one wishes for.<br /><br />Charlie"]}
{"text": ["This was a great novel; and great translation to English (with some footnotes to explain certain choices).  I am not fluent in Chinese - but have some understanding of the cultural drivers in recent history - so the footnotes were revealing to me at any rate.  Amazon forcing me to choose between various moods at the outset of this review left me torn.  I chose suspenseful - but feel that hopeful, dark, nostalgic, and thoughtful all applied.  Light-hearted, not so much.<br /><br />Much like Carl Sagan's &#34;Contact&#34; this novel posits alien contact in a somewhat more realistic way than say &#34;Independence Day&#34;.  The motivations of the various characters are believable and, fully human.  The course the plot takes means you might guess the end point, but you'll likely be wildly wrong about the road you'll take to get there."]}
{"text": ["Very interesting and accessible translation. The story is phenomenal, and imaginative. It definitely retains a taste of a different literary style than a standard American Science fiction book. I think I also learned a bit about the Chinese Cultural revolution from a different point of view."]}

By the end, I just had to get the second book right away! I’m about half way through the second book now and it’s action packed from the start! So just get through the slow start and you won’t regret it!!"]}
{"text": ["It is a very original book. The historical background is important for the plot, and I learned a little bit about the history of China and the Cultural Revolution as a bonus. The existence conditions of the Trisolarans are quite interesting and original. This is a hard science fiction book. The pace is slow at times, but in general it flows well and captures the reader's attention."]}

What I mean by that, is that this series has permanently changed: the way I look at the stars, the way I perceive time, the way I think about life, the way I think about SETI, the way I think about the meaning of life, the way I think about human beings' place in the universe, the way I view technology, etc.<br /><br />This series well and truly &#34;blew my mind away&#34;.  This isn't a page0-turning space opera adventure kind of story.  The story is interesting and good, and there is most definitely some drama and entertainment - and the writing is excellent (translation to English is superb).  But the main thing for me about this series is that it educated me about physics and really made me look at EVERYTHING through a new lens.  The ideas in this book I had never encountered before - and I am a voracious reader.  I found this series to be totally original and mind-blowing.  There were time where I simply needed to put it down after reading only a short time, in order to simply ponder the ideas presented.  I've never had quite an experience like this with a book.<br /><br />Highly recommend this series.  And, make sure you read all three, because each one is better than the last.  The last book of the series was my favorite and just absolutely melted my brain.  I mean, to the degree where I am questioning my own reality.  Yes, it is that good.  Really, a mind and perception altering experience."]}

My apologies, but I can’t tell you because I apparently read something completely different from everyone else!<br /><br />Absolutely zero character development, I mean nothing!

Utter-Rancid-Rotting-Garbage!!!<br /><br />To leave my sardonic humour aside for a second, perhaps it really did not translate well from Chinese...similar to how Crazy Rich Asians (also garbage, but entertaining garbage!) was hugely profitable in the US, but an absolute bomb at China’s Box Office.<br /><br />I’m so alone...someone please help me...please explain how I was led astray by so many?!"]}
{"text": ["I'm about 25% into the book. I doubt I'll finish it. I have a Ph.D. in Physics, and my graduate program had a strong Particle Physics department (though I specialized elsewhere). The author shows a startling lack of understanding of what motivates Physicists and how they think, to a point where the book is ruined for me.<br /><br />There is also rather ... amateur hour writing, which may be due to the translator.<br /><br />Spoiler version:<br /><br />In the book plot, the invariance of physics under translations in time and space has been proved to be wrong at higher energies, and because of this \"There is no Physics\" and scientists have started killing themselves due to despair. This is nonsense.<br /><br />In the real world, Particle Physics has gotten rather boring and predictable. Short of some absurd theoretical results at energies that we can't test experimentally, the Standard Model has tremendous explanatory power and has explained all experiments and predicted new results correctly. CERN discovered the Higgs, as expected, but has brought out no new Physics, thus far. This is disappointing. Much, much more exciting would be a field breaking result, (such as a new, previously unknown, variance of Physics in time and space at higher energies). Particle Physics would be fun again.<br /><br />Similarly, when Wang Miao starts seeing a countdown, instead of jumping to the most likely conclusion (that he is becoming mental ill, and needs outside, non-biased verification of what he is seeing) or that he is receiving messages from some outside intelligence, he starts to go crazy in a very over the top and amateurishly written way."]}
{"text": ["After slogging though far too much science narrative while finding virtually nonexistent character development, I had to laugh when I read that the author started life as an engineer.

There are several compelling and interesting characters in this book.<br /><br />Above all else the plot, world-building and pacing of the book are completely top notch.  To have a hard sci-fi book that is not about space marines and laser guns but still manages to be a page-turner that you can't put down is an amazing achievement!  This book represents the best in science fiction.  It's about big ideas and examining possibilities.  I refuse to discuss the plot but if you have an interest in science and technology and love the hard sci-fi genre, stop reading this review and order the book immediately!<br /><br />I will provide one disclaimer.  If you have no interest in science whatsoever or just lack an aptitude or understanding of it, this book series may not be for you.  You don't need to be a rocket scientist to enjoy this book but you probably will need to have at least a baseline understanding of some basic scientific principals and/or a willingness to google some stuff.<br /><br />Anyway, get it!!"]}
{"text": ["It's impossible to rate this book on it's own since it's part of a stunning trilogy, and the quality of this book only really shines in the context of the whole. Cixin gets very technical in parts, and descriptions of physics can go on, and on. For that reason, I am glad that I had an audiobook for this one. I'm an academic, and already do a lot of reading, and some sections would start to feel more like work than relaxation. Still, I might have drifted off a little here and there during the most intense technical descriptions, but still paid enough attention to learn a bit about the speed of light, black holes and different dimensions.<br /><br />I also put the series down in the middle of the second book when I realized that there was not a single female character left that was a significant part of the narrative. But, I came back to it eventually, and I'm so glad I did. As it turns out, the 3rd book is largely from a feminine point of view, and thinking back, I'm pretty sure that Cixin was intentionally emphasizing a masculine point of view in the second book.<br /><br />Otherwise, the incredible scope of this book and the sheer audacity of even trying to tell this the story Cixin tells is breathtaking. It even has the quality of a fairy tale, but not a modern Disney version, more like the old dark folk tales of the past. Cixin waxes and wanes from optimism and despair, destruction and renewal and yin and yang throughout. As with life, there is no fairy tale ending, the story just ends when it ends.<br /><br />I'm going to be thinking about this story for many years to come."]}

Perhaps its an aspect of how different Chinese cultural expectations are from ours. Anyhow ... the entire story seemed rather silly to me ... and after seeing all those 4 and 5 star reviews gushing about how intense and deep this story was ... I'm thinking those reviewers must have only ever been exposed to Dr Seuss stories before if they found this book to be deep. It is not deep. It is not masterful. It is not mind-blowing or eye-opening or any of the other superlatives and hyperbolic praise phrases that some reader/reviewers have posted. It's not a bad story, but it is definitely not anywhere near the realm of the hard-science fiction masters ... compared to Asher and Corey and Douglas, this is YA territory."]}
{"text": ["It's hard to know where to begin talking about The Three-Body Problem trilogy (officially known as the Remembrance of Earth's Past series), a truly staggering piece of science-fiction written by Chinese author Cixin Liu and translated to English by Ken Liu and Joel Martinsen (Liu did books 1 and 3, while Martinsen did 2). A trilogy that spans literally thousands of years, deals with quantum physics, game theory, sociology, religion, space exploration, space colonization, and more, all driven by the nature of first contact with alien intelligence - there's a lot going on in this series, and that's before you start realizing just how much Cixin (reminder: Chinese names are traditionally written with the family name first and the given name second) truly takes on the advanced science of his ideas. And yet, when you finish it, you realize that you've read something truly incredible - a piece of hard science-fiction whose ambition, scope, richness, and ideas are impossible not to find yourself thinking about for days afterward.<br /><br />The series begins with The Three-Body Problem, which opens during the Chinese Revolution, depicting the conflict between science and politics in stark, honest terms -a theme that the series will grapple with often, in wildly different ways. We flash forward, though, to a near future, where scientists are killing themselves for unclear reasons. What this has to do with the characters from that Revolution-era prologue, a government program attempting to reach out to the galaxy in search of alien intelligence, and a complex computer simulation of a civilization subject to bewildering rules of nature, Cixin takes his time to explain. But what becomes clear quickly is that The Three-Body Problem is, in a way, a novel about first contact, and how humanity will react to a race whose purposes for coming here may not be entirely benevolent.<br /><br />If you're thinking that all of this sounds like a basic setup for an alien invasion novel, rest assured, that is definitely not what you're getting with The Three-Body Problem. Instead, Cixin explores the social implications of such an arrival, and deals head-on with the complex questions that it would cause. Would humanity band together in the face of this, or would our already existing divisions fracture even deeper? Would people be terrified of this advanced race, or would they be viewed as gods? And would people truly feel that humanity is worth saving, or would they welcome a race who could bring out peace, even through subjugation? These aren't simple ideas, but Cixin makes them the meat of the book, along with advanced discussions about the alien planet, which is governed by three suns, leaving their homeworld incapable of safe habitation (the source of the novel's title).<br /><br />More than that, Cixin takes no shortcuts in his story, embracing hard science-fiction as a way of dealing with his scenario. Communication across multiple light-years, limited telescopic technology, the disconnect between human and alien intelligences, relativity, black holes - all of this is relevant to the book, and while Cixin makes it accessible, be aware, this book doesn't spoon feed you its physics. You're going to have to come with some willingness to think about the advanced concepts on display and ponder them, from gravitational forces to quantum computing. It's not pure technobabble, but it's a challenging read at times, and assumes its readers have the willingness to take on its science. <br /><br />If you do, though, what you'll get is a complex, fascinating book about first contact, one that's not quite like anything else I've read in how it handles the questions that such a contact would bring about. And while it's the first book in a trilogy, none of that keeps the book from standing on its own, leaving room for further exploration but existing as a single piece of work that's already remarkable on its own.<br /><br />To explain this series is a difficult challenge, to put it mildly. This is a series that spans a huge amount of time, deals with advanced scientific concepts in complex terms, grapples with rich philosophical and political ideas, debates questions without easy answers, and gives you a scope that can be daunting. It's a story of alien invasions, yes, but one in which the action sequences we're so used to are replaced with existential dread, a rethinking of our own lives, and a fear of the unknown that's hard to quantify. It's also the story of people caught up in these times, trying to give themselves a good life while never forgetting the larger questions of their era, and juggling their own fears with fears for humanity. In other words, it's what hard science-fiction is great at - thoughtful questions, big ideas, and speculation, all of which change the way you think about the world.<br /><br />This series is a truly incredible achievement, one that honestly left me a bit staggered and reeling as I attempt to think about it all, but one that I love all the more for what it accomplishes. If you're a hard science-fiction fan, or simply someone who loves dealing with the complex ramifications of common ideas, this is a must read series. I've never read anything like it in my life, and I'm a richer person for the ideas it's inspired me to think about."]}

I think the TV shields the signal and I could not get my laptop to connect to it, even though I connected easily when testing on a monitor. I think it also helps to have an external usb plug like used on your phone, instead of the TV USB port as shown in the set up. I don't think the USB on the TV supplies enough power to give it a good signal. Maybe by gen 3 it will be plug and play but for now there's some caveats to getting it working."]}
{"text": ["I have been lusting after a wireless projector for some time now... and this $40 item has satisfied that need, saving me hundreds. It came quickly, was well packaged and is pretty much a \"plug and play\" item, eliminating long cables and connection difficulties, at least so far! I tested it in a fairly small area but was able to move at least 25' from the projector and it still worked. One place I'm anxious to try is classrooms where there is a large screen TV that isn't easily reachable. It will be necessary to plug the adapter into a cable... I don't see any reason that wouldn't work, as long as I can get power to the USB plug. So far I'm quite pleased!"]}
{"text": ["Even after going through an hour of troubleshooting on the Microsoft website I was unable to get this to work. I was very excited for this product, as I've seen it used in a work environment and it seemed to work well. Unfortunately it definitely doesn't work right out of the box, and it's not worth spending hours configuring your computer and uninstalling / rolling back drivers to get this to work. Looks like I'm sticking with the Chromecast for now."]}
{"text": ["I've used several wireless display adapters over the years and this one is simply the best.  Very easy to use and absolutely no complaints about it's basic functionality.<br /><br />The Windows App is used to update the firmware (should you need to) and you can adjust overscan with it as well, which is nice.  The App though is like most of Microsoft's software and is a little flaky.<br /><br />I did the firmware update and a quarter of the way through the app said it failed and the wireless adapter suddenly restarted, it then stayed at a Microsoft screen for several minutes and appeared to go into a reboot loop.  I thought for sure it bricked the adapter.  After about 5 minutes however it came back up and had the latest firmware.  The app shows the latest firmware too but the app keeps nagging me a firmware update is available (same version).  So the tried and true Microsoft buggy software aside, the hardware is the best on the market.<br /><br />I can stream 1080P content with audio from my couch without any issue.  Works great with my android phone too."]}
{"text": ["If you have you have one of the rare supported devices (which you may or may not be supported even if you have windows 8 or 10) with correct version, and have your tv Next to said device, AND expect nothing but the choppiest, random, low resolution experience, then this is for you!<br /><br />I should note I'm not a novice, im a programmer by day, but the quality, setup, and performance of this device is simply insulting, and its not because im a power user.<br /><br />When its working, the quality seems worse than 720p, is laggy, and the mouse somehow does not line up correctly.  I was only able to have this happen when the computer was directly below the screen.  It is halfway useable for... maybe the most basic of tasks, i wouldn't expect to watch video, or get any work done.<br /><br />When I put it on a tv about 6 feet away, it barely connected, but has actual minutes of delay.  I did hear it play a sound once, so theres that.  I should note that the wireless on that computer also seemed to grind to a halt?  so I had to connect ethernet cord, cant say 100% if those are related.<br /><br />This is with the latest windows 10, and a latest firmware adapter.<br /><br />I started by connecting my windows 10 bootcamped macbook to tv.  I only got a black screen on tv.  I tried changing display settings to 'remote only'  well that was a mistake.  Now my laptop was black, and tv was black...  windows + p eventually let me see my desktop but how do you change the setting now?  You cant change setting until device is connected (and black).  I think restarting everything solved it eventually.  I tried connecting adapter to a new monitor close by and it too just turned black.  And any material you find on line likely wont help, nor will the app store adapter application, nor will updating firmware, or windows.<br /><br />There are too many alternative solutions to use this one, unless you are absolutely desperate.  Maybe streaming from android device is another deal.<br /><br />Only pros i can find are price... and fact you don't have to have wireless i guess?  but you probably have wireless anyway, and the reliability and quality simply is not worth that trade off."]}
{"text": ["This thing really works and easy to set up. I got it today and in less than 10 minutes, I have my laptop display streaming on my TV. I set my laptop display to extended display to my TV monitor, so I have my laptop monitor displaying one document that I am working on, and the TV monitor displaying a reference document that I need for the document that I am working on in my laptop.  Exactly how I was planning to use it.<br />I wanted to buy a wireless monitor to connect my laptop when I am working from home 2 days a week, but since I don't have a space for another monitor on my desk because I already have two monitors for my personal home computer and a TV, I searched for alternative and I came across this adapter. My TV has USB and HDMI port already, so I thought I should give it a try.  I am glad I did. It saved me money and space."]}
{"text": ["Got the adapter to enable us to use mobile devices on the large display in our Conference Room at work.<br /><br />Seems to work fine for our Windows 10 devices, corporate or personal.  Also works fine on my personal Samsung Tab S2 (Android) and on my personal Win10 laptop.  No experience with Apple, but suspect it's fine because Apple is very customer-centric.<br /><br />Apparently the Android Pixel XL does NOT support MiraCast.  From what I've been reading, it looks like ALL Google devices have disabled this ability, even on rooted devices (which you used to be able to make it work on).  Also, it looks like all NON-Google devices work fine with MiraCast.  These devices ONLY support Google's proprietary ChromCast.  THANKS GOOGLE!"]}
{"text": ["I purchased this adapter after successfully using it at work on a Sony Bravia monitor with HDMI ports. I ordered based on this success. What I didn't realize was that I needed to have a TV that was compatible. I own an older Vizio TV that works great when I directly plug into HDMI, but wireless, it doesn't work. I tried many times to switch ports, to no avail. I returned it. It works great at my workplace. Sound and video are amazing, with no lag that I can detect. I was running this from a Dell XPS 15  and a Dell Latitude E5470. I believe that this is the best product out there, just beware."]}
{"text": ["This adapter is just what I wanted. We have a cabin in northern Wisconsin with little to no cell service and only two tv stations. This adapter allows me to download Netflix shows at home and play them on our TV at the cabin. No wifi or cell service is need to use the adapter. It has linked up successfully to my Droid Tubo 2 and Asus ZenPad. The picture and sound quality is great. I have only had once during a movie that the sound started to lag the video slightly. I paused the movie for a second and then restarted it with no lag."]}
{"text": ["We first bought a Microsoft wireless display adapter to use in a conference room setting. The adapter is plugged into the HDMI port on a projector and power is supplied via a USB extension cable connected to an Apple iPhone wall wart. Have been using it for about a year with absolutely no problems. We simply turn on the projector, the screen comes up that the adapter is ready to connect, users go to Project to another device on their laptop or tablet, and they connect from there. No drop outs or stuttering. All in all a very good experience. We purchased the additional adapter to connect to a TV in a board room and the experience has been the same. I would recommend this device for work. I can't comment on how well it works for streaming movies or video games."]}
